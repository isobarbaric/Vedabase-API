In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna\u2019s is to be cleared by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually; since the living entity is in contact with material nature, he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature."

            "purport": "Purport\nEveryone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, originally he is nirgu\u1e47a, or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.\nThe word \u015braddh\u0101, or \u201cfaith,\u201d is very significant in this verse. \u015araddh\u0101, or faith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One\u2019s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One\u2019s strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one\u2019s faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one\u2019s faith is established. It should be understood that if one\u2019s heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship."

            "purport": "Purport\nIn this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.\nNow, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower-class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (4.3.23) it is said, sattva\u1e41 vi\u015buddha\u1e41 vasudeva-\u015babditam: \u201cWhen a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\u0101sudeva.\u201d The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThe impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahm\u0101 is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature."

For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural injunctions and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for material enjoyment. By such activities, not only is the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa\u1e25 is significant in this connection. Persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the wombs of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life\u2019s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, d\u0101l, whole wheat, etc.\nFoods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except pras\u0101dam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.\nRemnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the pras\u0101dam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunctions of the scripture and offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind\u2019s becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense.

            "purport": "Purport\nIt has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme \u2013 o\u1e41 tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal \u2013 they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, o\u1e41 tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word o\u1e41 is always found.\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the mode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words o\u1e41 tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., o\u1e41 tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, o\u1e41 is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. O\u1e41 ity etad brahma\u1e47o nedi\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e41 n\u0101ma indicates the first goal. Then tat tvam asi (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And sad eva saumya (Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad 6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become o\u1e41 tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\u0101, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for o\u1e41 tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way."

The words used are sat\u0101\u1e41 prasa\u1e45g\u0101t. Without good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words o\u1e41 tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of performance of yaj\u00f1a the object is the Supreme, o\u1e41 tat sat. The word tad-arth\u012byam further means offering service to anything which represents the Supreme, including such service as cooking and helping in the Lord\u2019s temple, or any other kind of work for broadcasting the glories of the Lord. These supreme words o\u1e41 tat sat are thus used in many ways to perfect all activities and make everything complete."

Therefore in this verse it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.\nIn the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak\u1e63as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should therefore take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Divisions of Faith."
