            "purport": "Purport\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the widely read theistic science summarized in the G\u012bt\u0101-m\u0101h\u0101tmya (Glorification of the G\u012bt\u0101). There it says that one should read Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the G\u012bt\u0101 directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the G\u012bt\u0101. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThe topics discussed by Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra and Sa\u00f1jaya, as described in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.\nThe word dharma-k\u1e63etra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons\u2019 ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa\u00f1jaya, \u201cWhat did they do?\u201d He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du were assembled in that Field of Kuruk\u1e63etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\u1e63etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship \u2013 even for the denizens of heaven \u2013 Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\u00f1jaya was a student of Vy\u0101sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra even while he was in the room of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. And so, Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.\nBoth the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra belong to the same family, but Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\u1e63etra, where the father of religion, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\u1e63etre and kuru-k\u1e63etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance."

            "purport": "Purport\nDh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Sa\u00f1jaya could understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. Sa\u00f1jaya wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent king and thus assured him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place. Sa\u00f1jaya therefore informed the king that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, at once went to the commander in chief, Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya, to inform him of the real position. Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He was therefore quite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana\u2019s diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas."

Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya had some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupad\u012b, who was Arjuna\u2019s wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberal br\u0101hma\u1e47a he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dadyumna took the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya. Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, who were also Dro\u1e47\u0101c\u0101rya\u2019s affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat."

The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhus\u016bdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\u0101sudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\u012b-nandana because He accepted Devak\u012b as His mother; His name is Ya\u015bod\u0101-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya\u015bod\u0101 at V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana; His name is P\u0101rtha-s\u0101rathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra.\nArjuna is referred to as Dhana\u00f1jaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\u012bma is known as V\u1e5bkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi\u1e0dimba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, beginning with the Lord\u2019s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So they were predestined to lose the battle \u2013 and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells."

Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory."

In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee\u2019s assuming the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. Since He is master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him. But when He finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible master in all circumstances.\nAs a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an unwanted war."

Thus a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constantly. This is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or sam\u0101dhi. As H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a could understand Arjuna\u2019s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies.

As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And while he was so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\u2019s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:\nyasy\u0101sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\u00f1can\u0101sarvair gu\u1e47ais tatra sam\u0101sate sur\u0101\u1e25har\u0101v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\u1e47\u0101mano-rathen\u0101sati dh\u0101vato bahi\u1e25\n\u201cOne who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 5.18.12)"

This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow G\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life."

When a man sees only frustration in his expectations, he thinks, \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d Everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is showing ignorance of his real self-interest by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s will. One\u2019s real self-interest lies in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

In such a blind conception of life, they forget even the causes of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a k\u1e63atriya.

Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he is not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as a k\u1e63atriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the k\u1e63atriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom. Arjuna\u2019s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lies in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do.

            "purport": "Purport\nArjuna has addressed Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Govinda because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should understand what will satisfy Arjuna\u2019s senses. But Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses. If we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way \u2013 namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one\u2019s own senses \u2013 then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna\u2019s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed on the battlefield and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life, however, is different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\u2019s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them."

What should we gain, O K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?",
            "purport": "Purport\nAccording to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: (1) a poison giver, (2) one who sets fire to the house, (3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, (4) one who plunders riches, (5) one who occupies another\u2019s land, and (6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k\u1e63atriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord R\u0101ma was so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord R\u0101ma (r\u0101ma-r\u0101jya), but Lord R\u0101ma never showed any cowardice. R\u0101va\u1e47a was an aggressor against R\u0101ma because R\u0101va\u1e47a kidnapped R\u0101ma\u2019s wife, S\u012bt\u0101, but Lord R\u0101ma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna\u2019s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna\u2019s addressing of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as \u201cM\u0101dhava,\u201d or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that, as the husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees."

There is a system in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution by which before death one has to undergo the process of atonement for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of atonement, called pr\u0101ya\u015bcitta. Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable lives as the result of sinful activities."
