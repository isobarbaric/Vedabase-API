            "purport": "Purport\nHerein we find the history of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order of all planets, beginning from the sun planet. The kings of all planets are especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and therefore the royal order should understand the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.\nIn this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasv\u0101n, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.52) it is stated:\nyac-cak\u1e63ur e\u1e63a savit\u0101 sakala-grah\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41r\u0101j\u0101 samasta-sura-m\u016brtir a\u015be\u1e63a-tej\u0101\u1e25yasy\u0101j\u00f1ay\u0101 bhramati sambh\u1e5bta-k\u0101la-cakrogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\n\u201cLet me worship,\u201d Lord Brahm\u0101 said, \u201cthe Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.\u201d\nThe sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasv\u0101n) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a originally made Vivasv\u0101n His first disciple to understand the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The G\u012bt\u0101 is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial.\nIn the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (\u015a\u0101nti-parva 348.51\u201352) we can trace out the history of the G\u012bt\u0101 as follows:\ntret\u0101-yug\u0101dau ca tatovivasv\u0101n manave dadaumanu\u015b ca loka-bh\u1e5bty-artha\u1e41sut\u0101yek\u1e63v\u0101kave dadauik\u1e63v\u0101ku\u1e47\u0101 ca kathitovy\u0101pya lok\u0101n avasthita\u1e25\n\u201cIn the beginning of the millennium known as Tret\u0101-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasv\u0101n to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord R\u0101macandra appeared.\u201d Therefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 existed in human society from the time of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku.\nAt the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dv\u0101para-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tret\u0101-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to his disciple and son Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, a rough estimate is that the G\u012bt\u0101 was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the G\u012bt\u0101, according to the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n because he is also a k\u1e63atriya and is the father of all k\u1e63atriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the s\u016brya-va\u1e41\u015ba k\u1e63atriyas. Because Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru\u1e63eya, superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the G\u012bt\u0101 must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the G\u012bt\u0101 in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku."

            "purport": "Purport\nIt is clearly stated that the G\u012bt\u0101 was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one\u2019s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the G\u012bt\u0101 appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the G\u012bt\u0101 (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, although they make a good business on the words of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the G\u012bt\u0101 in English, as it is received by the parampar\u0101 (disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2013 accepted as it is \u2013 is a great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time."

Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the G\u012bt\u0101 following in the footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science.

            "purport": "Purport\nArjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appeared as the son of Devak\u012b on this earth. How K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a when they are spoken by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha \u2013 the eternal form of bliss and knowledge \u2013 that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna\u2019s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature."

It is stated there:\nadvaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam\u0101dya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47a-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 nava-yauvana\u1e41 cavede\u1e63u durlabham adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktaugovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\n\u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is the original person \u2013 absolute, infallible, without beginning. Although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.\u201d\nIt is also stated in Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.39):\nr\u0101m\u0101di-m\u016brti\u1e63u kal\u0101-niyamena ti\u1e63\u1e6dhann\u0101n\u0101vat\u0101ram akarod bhuvane\u1e63u kintuk\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 svaya\u1e41 samabhavat parama\u1e25 pum\u0101n yogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\n\u201cI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a], who is always situated in various incarnations such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who incarnates personally also.\u201d\nIn the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaid\u016brya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas (vede\u1e63u durlabham adurlabham \u0101tma-bhaktau). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to the sun-god Vivasv\u0101n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the G\u012bt\u0101 cannot be understood by demonic brains. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-\u0101nanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit \u2013 whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord\u2019s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past \u201cbirths,\u201d whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His prak\u1e5bti, or His form. Prak\u1e5bti means \u201cnature,\u201d as well as svar\u016bpa, or \u201cone\u2019s own form.\u201d The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation \u2013 past, present and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun\u2019s rising, moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun has set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency \u2013 and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the Bh\u0101gavatam, He appears before His mother as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord\u2019s forms to be. The word m\u0101y\u0101, or \u0101tma-m\u0101y\u0101, refers to the Lord\u2019s causeless mercy, according to the Vi\u015bva-ko\u015ba dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe word s\u1e5bj\u0101mi is significant herein. S\u1e5bj\u0101mi cannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord\u2019s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore, s\u1e5bj\u0101mi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of the Dv\u0101para-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of Brahm\u0101, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahm\u0101, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the G\u012bt\u0101, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears. From the Bh\u0101gavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avat\u0101ra unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same \u2013 to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.\nThe principles of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner\u2019s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances."

Although Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja was the son of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\u012b, the mother of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, was the sister of Ka\u1e41sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was to be born of them. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared primarily to deliver Devak\u012b rather than kill Ka\u1e41sa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.\nIn the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ad\u0101sa Kavir\u0101ja, the following verses (Madhya 20.263\u2013264) summarize these principles of incarnation:\ns\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di-hetu yei m\u016brti prapa\u00f1ce avataresei \u012b\u015bvara-m\u016brti \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma dhare\nm\u0101y\u0101t\u012bta paravyome sab\u0101ra avasth\u0101navi\u015bve avatari\u2019 dhare \u2018avat\u0101ra\u2019 n\u0101ma\n\u201cThe avat\u0101ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\u0101ra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avat\u0101ra.\u201d\nThere are various kinds of avat\u0101ras, such as puru\u1e63\u0101vat\u0101ras, gu\u1e47\u0101vat\u0101ras, l\u012bl\u0101vat\u0101ras, \u015bakty-\u0101ve\u015ba avat\u0101ras, manvantara-avat\u0101ras and yug\u0101vat\u0101ras \u2013 all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avat\u0101ras. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a avat\u0101ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.\nThe Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, who spread the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of sa\u1e45k\u012brtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upani\u1e63ads, Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Bh\u0101gavatam. The devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very much attracted by the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avat\u0101ra of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by His causeless mercy."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Lord\u2019s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the sixth verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yog\u012bs attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve \u2013 merging into the impersonal brahma-jyotir of the Lord \u2013 is only partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam an\u0101dim ananta-r\u016bpam. Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the Vedas (Puru\u1e63a-bodhin\u012b Upani\u1e63ad):\neko devo nitya-l\u012bl\u0101nuraktobhakta-vy\u0101p\u012b h\u1e5bdy antar-\u0101tm\u0101\n\u201cThe one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.\u201d This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the G\u012bt\u0101 personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version tat tvam asi is actually applied in this case. Anyone who understands Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, \u201cYou are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,\u201d is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:\ntam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum etin\u0101nya\u1e25 panth\u0101 vidyate \u2019yan\u0101ya\n\u201cOne can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no other way to achieve this perfection.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8) That there is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed-up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection."

            "purport": "Purport\nAs described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bh\u0101va, or transcendental love of Godhead.\nAccording to Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.4.15\u201316), the science of devotional service:\n\u0101dau \u015braddh\u0101 tata\u1e25 s\u0101dhu-sa\u1e45go \u2019tha bhajana-kriy\u0101tato \u2019nartha-niv\u1e5btti\u1e25 sy\u0101ttato ni\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 rucis tata\u1e25\nath\u0101saktis tato bh\u0101vastata\u1e25 prem\u0101bhyuda\u00f1catis\u0101dhak\u0101n\u0101m aya\u1e41 prem\u1e47a\u1e25pr\u0101durbh\u0101ve bhavet krama\u1e25\n\u201cIn the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is matured in bh\u0101va, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called prema, the highest perfectional stage of life.\u201d In the prema stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one\u2019s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal brahma-jyotir effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the object of everyone\u2019s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one\u2019s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son and still another as his lover. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the yaj\u00f1e\u015bvara; and those who are yog\u012bs seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.3.10):\nak\u0101ma\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101mo v\u0101mok\u1e63a-k\u0101ma ud\u0101ra-dh\u012b\u1e25t\u012bvre\u1e47a bhakti-yogenayajeta puru\u1e63a\u1e41 param\n\u201cWhether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive results or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection, culminating in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\u201d"

            "purport": "Purport\nThere is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God\u2019s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nity\u0101n\u0101m: God is one. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. The Supreme God is one \u2013 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nity\u0101n\u0101m) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God \u2013 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0d\u012b. Even the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva (\u015biva-viri\u00f1ci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devat\u0101\u1e25 denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (h\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101na) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \u201cbig guns\u201d in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worshiping empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called br\u0101hma\u1e47as due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the k\u1e63atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vai\u015byas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the \u015b\u016bdras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is above even the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Although br\u0101hma\u1e47as by quality are supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, becomes a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 or, in other words, a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, namely R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha, etc. And as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species."

He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm\u1e5bti confirms this fact as follows:\nnimitta-m\u0101tram ev\u0101saus\u1e5bjy\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 sarga-karma\u1e47ipradh\u0101na-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b-bh\u016bt\u0101yato vai s\u1e5bjya-\u015baktaya\u1e25\n\u201cIn the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made visible.\u201d The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (2.1.34) it is confirmed, vai\u1e63amya-nairgh\u1e5b\u1e47ye na s\u0101pek\u1e63atv\u0101t: the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

This is recommended in the fifteenth verse. Why such action should not be independent will be explained in the text to follow.\nTo act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter. The system of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ik\u1e63v\u0101ku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.\nIt is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself. Dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam (Bh\u0101g. 6.3.19). No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, N\u0101rada, Manu, the Kum\u0101ras, Kapila, Prahl\u0101da, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b, Yamar\u0101ja, Janaka and Bali Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence."

The entire Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions against this consciousness and its attendant actions are vikarmas, or prohibited actions.

            "purport": "Purport\nHow activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as set forth here in the G\u012bt\u0101. This process is generally known as yaj\u00f1a, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The word brahma (Brahman) means \u201cspiritual.\u201d The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahma-jyotir, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahma-jyotir, but when the jyotir is covered by illusion (m\u0101y\u0101) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor and the result are \u2013 all combined together \u2013 Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by m\u0101y\u0101 is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is said to be in sam\u0101dhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yaj\u00f1a, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance and the result or ultimate gain \u2013 everything \u2013 becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factually sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is also known as Yaj\u00f1a. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-\u012b\u015bvara-v\u0101d\u012b, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self \u2013 everything \u2013 is sacrificed for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus, he is the first-class yog\u012b; but he does not lose his individual existence."

Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmac\u0101r\u012bs, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b hears only words concerning K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmac\u0101r\u012b engages fully in harer n\u0101m\u0101nuk\u012brtanam \u2013 chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord.

Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratification. Marriage on the principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of yaj\u00f1a because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life."

In the Yoga-s\u016btra of Pata\u00f1jali, the soul is called pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 and par\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101. As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called par\u0101g-\u0101tm\u0101, but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101. The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Pata\u00f1jali system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the body\u2019s air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this yoga system, pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 is the ultimate goal. This pratyag-\u0101tm\u0101 is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, and hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the pr\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101yu. The ap\u0101na-v\u0101yu goes downwards, vy\u0101na-v\u0101yu acts to shrink and expand, sam\u0101na-v\u0101yu adjusts equilibrium, ud\u0101na-v\u0101yu goes upwards \u2013 and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization."

In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like dharma-\u015b\u0101l\u0101, anna-k\u1e63etra, atithi-\u015b\u0101l\u0101, an\u0101th\u0101laya and vidy\u0101-p\u012b\u1e6dha. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candr\u0101ya\u1e47a and c\u0101turm\u0101sya. These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the c\u0101turm\u0101sya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yaj\u00f1a. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Pata\u00f1jali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or ha\u1e6dha-yoga or a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yaj\u00f1a, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the Upani\u1e63ads and Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, or the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy. All of these are called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya-yaj\u00f1a, or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these yog\u012bs are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifice but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotees. Therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental."

            "purport": "Purport\nThis system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, and in the beginning it is practiced in the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the directions of their passage. The ap\u0101na air goes downward, and the pr\u0101\u1e47a air goes up. The pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma-yog\u012b practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into p\u016braka, equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath into the inhaled breath is called recaka. When both air currents are completely stopped, one is said to be in kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, one can increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization. The intelligent yog\u012b is interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting for the next. For by practicing kumbhaka-yoga, the yog\u012bs increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (14.26):\nm\u0101\u1e41 ca yo \u2019vyabhic\u0101re\u1e47abhakti-yogena sevatesa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101nbrahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate\n\u201cOne who engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord transcends the modes of material nature and is immediately elevated to the spiritual platform.\u201d A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pras\u0101dam, or food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement."

In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one\u2019s dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of yaj\u00f1a we can have enough food, enough milk, etc. \u2013 even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yaj\u00f1a according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life even in this body, and what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yaj\u00f1a. But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A life of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence."

Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one\u2019s faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit.

The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The Bh\u0101gavatam (6.3.19) says, dharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d bhagavat-pra\u1e47\u012btam: the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The sense of an existence separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101 (m\u0101 \u2013 not, y\u0101 \u2013 this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers wrongly think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.\nFor want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although we are separated parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is m\u0101y\u0101, or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By m\u0101y\u0101 alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The whole teaching of the G\u012bt\u0101 is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s eternal servitor, cannot be separated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and his sense of being an identity apart from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is called m\u0101y\u0101. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitv\u0101nyath\u0101-r\u016bpa\u1e41 svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. Liberation means to be situated in one\u2019s constitutional position as an eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness)."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe yoga system instructed in this chapter is called san\u0101tana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one\u2019s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one\u2019s own self (or one\u2019s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the G\u012bt\u0101 is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas and in partaking of the social institution called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but one who doubts the authority of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as it is expressed in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge."
