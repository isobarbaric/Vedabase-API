And the path of realization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Sometimes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But without being trained in the philosophy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in a secluded place, where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in this Third Chapter."

This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. Although K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 either by inertia or by active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."

            "purport": "Purport\nIn the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of procedures \u2013 namely s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. S\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as it is explained in the sixty-first verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the thirty-ninth verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the sixty-first verse \u2013 that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting everything with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of these two, the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime."

According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sanny\u0101sa, or retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. But Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not approve this principle. Without purification of heart, sanny\u0101sa is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga).

The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by the illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the \u015b\u0101stras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.5.17) affirms this:\ntyaktv\u0101 sva-dharma\u1e41 cara\u1e47\u0101mbuja\u1e41 harerbhajann apakvo \u2019tha patet tato yadiyatra kva v\u0101bhadram abh\u016bd amu\u1e63ya ki\u1e41ko v\u0101rtha \u0101pto \u2019bhajat\u0101\u1e41 sva-dharmata\u1e25\n\u201cIf someone takes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the \u015b\u0101stras or execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the \u015b\u0101stras, what does it avail him if he is not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious?\u201d So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, sanny\u0101sa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, without which everything is considered a failure."

Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to maintain one\u2019s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is therefore performance of yaj\u00f1a as it is prescribed in this verse. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution also aims at satisfying Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.

Any other work done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or under the direct instruction of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God."

All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: vedai\u015b ca sarvair aham eva vedya\u1e25. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: pati\u1e41 vi\u015bvasy\u0101tme\u015bvaram.

The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yaj\u00f1as (sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety, and after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj\u00f1a, the conditioned souls gradually become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness go well together.

Their pleasures and displeasures are dependent on the performance of yaj\u00f1as by the human being. Some of the yaj\u00f1as are meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is worshiped in all yaj\u00f1as as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yaj\u00f1as: bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a-tapas\u0101m.

            "purport": "Purport\nThe demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yaj\u00f1as. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yaj\u00f1as prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yaj\u00f1as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis \u2013 namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K\u0101l\u012b, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is recommended. But ultimately all yaj\u00f1as are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yaj\u00f1as, known as pa\u00f1ca-mah\u0101-yaj\u00f1a, are necessary.\nOne should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life \u2013 none of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials \u2013 all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yaj\u00f1as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yaj\u00f1as. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yaj\u00f1a, namely the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

The Supreme Lord, who is known as the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra and Varu\u1e47a are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, offer food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then eat \u2013 a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, who eats only food offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting pras\u0101dam of the Lord (food offered to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.\nFood grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity \u2013 that is the law of nature. Yaj\u00f1a, specifically the sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply."

If we have to work for the satisfaction of the yaj\u00f1a-puru\u1e63a, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said, asya mahato bh\u016btasya ni\u015bvasitam etad yad \u1e5bg-vedo yajur-veda\u1e25 s\u0101ma-vedo \u2019tharv\u0101\u1e45girasa\u1e25. \u201cThe four Vedas \u2013 namely the \u1e5ag Veda, Yajur Veda, S\u0101ma Veda and Atharva Veda \u2013 are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead.\u201d (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 4.5.11) The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, for as it is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one\u2019s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yaj\u00f1a by becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Even those who have not followed the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic yaj\u00f1as, or karmas."

Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yaj\u00f1as is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature\u2019s law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways \u2013 namely karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yaj\u00f1as for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yaj\u00f1a performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yaj\u00f1a system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\u00f1as are directly aimed at the particular demigods mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\u00f1as one is sure to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. But if by performing yaj\u00f1as one does not become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called \u0101c\u0101rya, or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of \u015b\u0101stra (scripture) to teach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader\u2019s teaching should be based on the principles of such standard \u015b\u0101stras. One who desires to improve himself must follow the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the schoolteacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependents; therefore they must be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes."

In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. The \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.33.30\u201331) affirms:\nnaitat sam\u0101carej j\u0101tumanas\u0101pi hy an\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25vina\u015byaty \u0101caran mau\u1e0dhy\u0101dyath\u0101rudro \u2019bdhi-ja\u1e41 vi\u1e63am\n\u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 vaca\u1e25 satya\u1e41tathaiv\u0101carita\u1e41 kvacitte\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 yat sva-vaco-yukta\u1e41buddhim\u0101\u1e41s tat sam\u0101caret\n\u201cOne should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered servants. Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person will perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to imitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in imitation of Lord \u015aiva.\u201d\nWe should always consider the position of the \u012b\u015bvaras, or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one cannot imitate the \u012b\u015bvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord \u015aiva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many pseudo devotees of Lord \u015aiva who want to indulge in smoking ga\u00f1j\u0101 (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord \u015aiva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some pseudo devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who prefer to imitate the Lord in His r\u0101sa-l\u012bl\u0101, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification.

The Lord instructs that one has to become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord, because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was therefore ordered by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, is called adhy\u0101tma-cet\u0101s. Nir\u0101\u015b\u012b\u1e25 means that one has to act on the order of the master but should not expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or \u201cunto Me.\u201d And when one acts in such K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or \u201cnothing is mine.\u201d And if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation."

As the Vedas are eternal, so this truth of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is also eternal. One should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord. There are many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 but have no faith in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of karma. In the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of m\u0101y\u0101 simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly or privately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence.

But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. According to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one\u2019s wife. All other women are to be considered as one\u2019s mother. But in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratification under regulations may also lead one to go astray \u2013 as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or acting always in the loving service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

Materially, prescribed duties are duties enjoined according to one\u2019s psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another\u2019s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a k\u1e63atriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a k\u1e63atriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a br\u0101hma\u1e47a who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the k\u1e63atriya may act as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a may act as a k\u1e63atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra was originally a k\u1e63atriya, but later on he acted as a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, whereas Para\u015bur\u0101ma was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a but later on he acted as a k\u1e63atriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

            "purport": "Purport\nWhen a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.\nThis inquiry is the beginning of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, wherein it is said, ath\u0101to brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam as janm\u0101dy asya yato \u2019nvay\u0101d itarata\u015b ca, or, \u201cThe origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.\u201d Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 or, in other words, desiring everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. Hanum\u0101n, the great servitor of Lord R\u0101ma, exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of R\u0101va\u1e47a, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the Lord. Here also, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, become our friends instead of our enemies."

This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living entity exhibits his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke-covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a little K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness under able guidance."

Vij\u00f1\u0101na refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul\u2019s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (2.9.31):\nj\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 parama-guhya\u1e41 meyad vij\u00f1\u0101na-samanvitamsa-rahasya\u1e41 tad-a\u1e45ga\u1e41 cag\u1e5bh\u0101\u1e47a gadita\u1e41 may\u0101\n\u201cThe knowledge of the self and Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if explained with their various aspects by the Lord Himself.\u201d Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives us that general and specific knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious and act accordingly.\nLust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead \u2013 the highest perfectional stage of human life."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act \u2013 as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad there is a similar passage, in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. Para\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad the soul has been described as mah\u0101n, the great. Therefore the soul is above all \u2013 namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.\nWith intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of the senses. But aside from that, one has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one\u2019s mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind."

In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature. Desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind \u2013 by steady intelligence directed toward one\u2019s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by higher intelligence.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or the Discharge of One\u2019s Prescribed Duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness."
