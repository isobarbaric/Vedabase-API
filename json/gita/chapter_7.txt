            "purport": "Purport\nIn this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the nature of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is fully described. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are described in this chapter.\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or in other words K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one\u2019s mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahma-jyotir or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and everything is revealed to the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically knows about brahma-jyotir and Param\u0101tm\u0101 in full. By practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full \u2013 namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.\nOne should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which \u015brava\u1e47am is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, tac ch\u1e5b\u1e47u, or \u201cHear from Me.\u201d No one can be a greater authority than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to become a perfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. One has therefore to learn from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly or from a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam this process of understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\n\u015b\u1e5b\u1e47vat\u0101\u1e41 sva-kath\u0101\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25pu\u1e47ya-\u015brava\u1e47a-k\u012brtana\u1e25h\u1e5bdy anta\u1e25-stho hy abhadr\u0101\u1e47ividhunoti suh\u1e5bt sat\u0101m\nna\u1e63\u1e6da-pr\u0101ye\u1e63v abhadre\u1e63unitya\u1e41 bh\u0101gavata-sevay\u0101bhagavaty uttama-\u015blokebhaktir bhavati nai\u1e63\u1e6dhik\u012b\ntad\u0101 rajas-tamo-bh\u0101v\u0101\u1e25k\u0101ma-lobh\u0101daya\u015b ca yeceta etair an\u0101viddha\u1e41sthita\u1e41 sattve pras\u012bdati\neva\u1e41 prasanna-manasobhagavad-bhakti-yogata\u1e25bhagavat-tattva-vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41mukta-sa\u1e45gasya j\u0101yate\nbhidyate h\u1e5bdaya-granthi\u015bchidyante sarva-sa\u1e41\u015bay\u0101\u1e25k\u1e63\u012byante c\u0101sya karm\u0101\u1e47id\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da ev\u0101tman\u012b\u015bvare\n\u201cTo hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is dwelling in everyone\u2019s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the Bh\u0101gavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of asa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e41 samagram, understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.2.17\u201321) Therefore only by hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or from His devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can one understand the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord in disciplic succession directly from the Lord. Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the source of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of yoga practice. When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown.

            "purport": "Purport\nThere are various grades of men, and out of many thousands, one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the G\u012bt\u0101 are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and discrimination of the self from matter. However, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be known only by persons who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. The yog\u012bs and j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are confused in their attempts to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, \u015ar\u012bp\u0101da \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya, has admitted in his G\u012bt\u0101 commentary that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as such, for it is very difficult to know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. \u012a\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25/ an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25 sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti, or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b writes in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.101):\n\u015bruti-sm\u1e5bti-pur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di-pa\u00f1car\u0101tra-vidhi\u1e41 vin\u0101aik\u0101ntik\u012b harer bhaktirutp\u0101t\u0101yaiva kalpate\n\u201cDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upani\u1e63ads, Pur\u0101\u1e47as and N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.\u201d\nIt is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the Param\u0101tm\u0101-realized yog\u012b to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101 or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (muhyanti yat s\u016braya\u1e25). M\u0101\u1e41 tu veda na ka\u015bcana: \u201cNo one knows Me as I am,\u201d the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25: \u201cSuch a great soul is very rare.\u201d Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is (tattvata\u1e25), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation \u2013 because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:\nata\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-n\u0101m\u0101dina bhaved gr\u0101hyam indriyai\u1e25sevonmukhe hi jihv\u0101dausvayam eva sphuraty ada\u1e25\n\u201cNo one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him.\u201d (Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu 1.2.234)"

The first one, Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param\u0101tm\u0101. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47us can be liberated from material entanglement.\u201d\nThis material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi\u1e63\u1e47u expansions of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These puru\u1e63as are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the puru\u1e63as \u2013 the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original cause of the material manifestation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahma-jyotir, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the brahma-jyotir as there are in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-lokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahma-jyotir as the ultimate eternal goal. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the K\u1e63\u012brodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.\nIn the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The false ego \u2013 \u201cI am,\u201d and \u201cIt is mine,\u201d which constitute the basic principle of material existence \u2013 includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of S\u0101\u1e45khya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."

            "purport": "Purport\nHere it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always controlled by the Lord \u2013 they have no independent existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.87.30) as follows:\naparimit\u0101 dhruv\u0101s tanu-bh\u1e5bto yadi sarva-gat\u0101starhi na \u015b\u0101syateti niyamo dhruva netarath\u0101ajani ca yan-maya\u1e41 tad avimucya niyant\u1e5b bhavetsamam anuj\u0101nat\u0101\u1e41 yad amata\u1e41 mata-du\u1e63\u1e6datay\u0101\n\u201cO Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a faulty and polluted opinion.\u201d\nThe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, \u201cI am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.\u201d His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may conclude that the G\u012bt\u0101 confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or liberated."

In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101: \u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.10): tato yad uttara-tara\u1e41 tad ar\u016bpam an\u0101mayam/ ya etad vidur am\u1e5bt\u0101s te bhavanti athetare du\u1e25kham ev\u0101piyanti. \u201cIn the material world Brahm\u0101, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahm\u0101 there is the Transcendence, who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.\u201d\nThe impersonalist puts more stress on the word ar\u016bpam. But this ar\u016bpam is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 quoted above. Other verses in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.8\u20139) substantiate this as follows:\nved\u0101ham eta\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 mah\u0101ntam\u0101ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101ttam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum etin\u0101nya\u1e25 panth\u0101 vidyate \u2019yan\u0101ya\nyasm\u0101t para\u1e41 n\u0101param asti ki\u00f1cidyasm\u0101n n\u0101\u1e47\u012byo no jy\u0101yo \u2019sti ki\u00f1citv\u1e5bk\u1e63a iva stabdho divi ti\u1e63\u1e6dhaty ekasteneda\u1e41 p\u016br\u1e47a\u1e41 puru\u1e63e\u1e47a sarvam\n\u201cI know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness.

            "purport": "Purport\nThis verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying tasty water to quench man\u2019s thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya bheda- and abheda-tattva \u2013 simultaneous oneness and difference.\nThe light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahma-jyotir, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And pra\u1e47ava, or the o\u1e41-k\u0101ra transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn, addresses the Supreme Lord. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound o\u1e41-k\u0101ra. But they do not realize that o\u1e41-k\u0101ra is the sound representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The jurisdiction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is blessed. Those who do not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are in illusion, and so knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage."

Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance and some taste.

But although life is temporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, by the spell of this illusory energy we consider ourselves in terms of this bodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian, Russian, or br\u0101hma\u1e47a, Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the modes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is behind all these modes. So Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that living entities deluded by these three modes of nature do not understand that behind the material background is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nThere are many different kinds of living entities \u2013 human beings, demigods, animals, etc. \u2013 and each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in the mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal feature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and renunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope is there for those in passion and ignorance? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is transcendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are truly established in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are actually liberated."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows: m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tu prak\u1e5bti\u1e41 vidy\u0101n m\u0101yina\u1e41 tu mahe\u015bvaram. \u201cAlthough m\u0101y\u0101 [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m\u0101y\u0101 is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe\u015bvara, the supreme controller.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 4.10)\nAnother meaning of gu\u1e47a is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself \u2013 he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, can help one gain such release. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being the Lord of the illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.\nThe words m\u0101m eva are also significant. M\u0101m means unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) only, and not Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva. Although Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is not possible for such incarnations of rajo-gu\u1e47a (passion) and tamo-gu\u1e47a (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101. In other words, both Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva are also under the influence of m\u0101y\u0101. Only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the master of m\u0101y\u0101; therefore He alone can give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8) confirm this in the phrase tam eva viditv\u0101, or \u201cFreedom is possible only by understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Even Lord \u015aiva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Lord \u015aiva says, mukti-prad\u0101t\u0101 sarve\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 vi\u1e63\u1e47ur eva na sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25: \u201cThere is no doubt that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.\u201d"

            "purport": "Purport\nIt is said in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don\u2019t these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?\nThe G\u012bt\u0101 answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva, Kapila, the Kum\u0101ras, Manu, Vy\u0101sa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahl\u0101da, Bali, and later on Madhv\u0101c\u0101rya, R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101c\u0101rya, \u015ar\u012b Caitanya and many others \u2013 who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc. \u2013 surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of \u201cplanning commissions.\u201d\nThe atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word du\u1e63k\u1e5btina\u1e25, or \u201cmiscreants.\u201d K\u1e5bt\u012b means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist\u2019s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b, which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.\nIn the G\u012bt\u0101 it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu and R\u0101va\u1e47a, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These du\u1e63k\u1e5btinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below.\n(1) The m\u016b\u1e0dhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice).\nMost often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such m\u016b\u1e0dhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life\u2019s all in all \u2013 despite the fact that the m\u016b\u1e0dhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world.\n(2) Another class of du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b, or miscreant, is called the nar\u0101dhama, or the lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered nar\u0101dhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man\u2019s relation with Him. In the G\u012bt\u0101 the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man\u2019s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a nar\u0101dhama. We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother\u2019s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by m\u0101y\u0101, the illusory energy.\nIt is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the Manu-sm\u1e5bti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama. However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is nar\u0101dhama.\nWhen the whole population becomes nar\u0101dhama, naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the G\u012bt\u0101, a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. \u015ar\u012b Nity\u0101nanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical nar\u0101dhamas, the brothers Jag\u0101i and M\u0101dh\u0101i, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the nar\u0101dhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.\n\u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu, in propagating the bh\u0101gavata-dharma, or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Nar\u0101dhamas, or the lowest of mankind, willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being.\n(3) The next class of du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b is called m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows \u2013 great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc. \u2013 but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.\nThere are a great number of m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In the G\u012bt\u0101, in plain and simple language, it is stated that \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of Brahm\u0101, the original father of all human beings. In fact, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is said to be not only the father of Brahm\u0101 but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 deride the personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.\nAll the unauthorized interpretations of the G\u012bt\u0101 by the class of m\u0101yay\u0101pah\u1e5bta-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, outside the purview of the parampar\u0101 system, are so many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.\n(4) The last class of du\u1e63k\u1e5bt\u012b is called \u0101sura\u1e41 bh\u0101vam \u0101\u015brit\u0101\u1e25, or those of demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the G\u012bt\u0101. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya \u0100labandaru of South India said, \u201cO my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Your uncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality\u2019s being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities.\u201d\nTherefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the deluded speculators and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice."

            "purport": "Purport\nUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures, and they are called su-k\u1e5btina\u1e25, or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men \u2013 those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees, because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit. The Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11) defines pure devotion thus:\nany\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam\u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu-\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir uttam\u0101\n\u201cOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.\u201d\nWhen these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.\nThose who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service."

And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his material body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association with pure devotees the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure.

He who is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected in devotional service that material contamination cannot touch him."

Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes, and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to V\u0101sudeva, or \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such a universal vision of V\u0101sudeva precipitates one\u2019s full surrender to the Supreme Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the highest goal.

Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in the lower modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 5.142) it is said, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya: only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is master, and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives."

            "purport": "Purport\nGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone\u2019s heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence \u2013 whatever one likes \u2013 but His ultimate instruction we find in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: one should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.\nBoth the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\u012b; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Um\u0101, the wife of Lord \u015aiva. In this way there are recommendations in the \u015b\u0101stras (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of all living entities, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature it is stated: \u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the supreme will. They are not independent.\u201d"

The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires.

Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god\u2019s planet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.\nHere the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don\u2019t know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn\u2019t very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.\nNot only are the demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the br\u0101hma\u1e47as are the head of the Supreme Lord, the k\u1e63atriyas are His arms, the vai\u015byas are His waist, the \u015b\u016bdras are His legs, and all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and he himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.\nThe results achieved by the demigods\u2019 benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited."

But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Stotra-ratna 12)\nIn the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the Ved\u0101nta literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\u0101nta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God\u2019s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as abuddhaya\u1e25, which means those who do not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul \u2013 but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.

Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be only the son of Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity.

As stated in the twenty-third verse, dev\u0101n deva-yajo y\u0101nti mad-bhakt\u0101 y\u0101nti m\u0101m api: the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a go to the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\u012bt\u0101 does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.\nTherefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is sac-cid-\u0101nanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedic literature confirms that the Supreme Absolute Truth is knowledge and blissful pleasure, vij\u00f1\u0101nam \u0101nandam brahma (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 3.9.28), and that He is the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities, ananta-kaly\u0101na-gu\u1e47\u0101tmako \u2019sau (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a 6.5.84). And in the G\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the G\u012bt\u0101 are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has both form and personality."

But actually He was not manifest to everyone. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when \u015ai\u015bup\u0101la spoke against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s being elected president of the assembly, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His internal potency.\nIn the prayers of Kunt\u012b in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.8.19) it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. This yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 curtain is also confirmed in the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad (Mantra 15), in which the devotee prays:\nhira\u1e47mayena p\u0101tre\u1e47asatyasy\u0101pihita\u1e41 mukhamtat tva\u1e41 p\u016b\u1e63ann ap\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e47usatya-dharm\u0101ya d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6daye\n\u201cO my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle. Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is covered by the yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. The brahma-jyotir is the covering of the internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the internal potency of the brahma-jyotir, and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account.\nAlso in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahm\u0101: \u201cO Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your internal potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them.\u201d The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not only unborn but also avyaya, inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible."

            "purport": "Purport\nHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were m\u0101y\u0101, material, as the impersonalists consider Him to be, then like the living entity He would change His body and forget everything about His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.\nUnlike the ordinary human being, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a remembers instructing Vivasv\u0101n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being\u2019s heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot realize \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and m\u0101y\u0101 is like a cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly, m\u0101y\u0101 cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, he cannot possibly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without being in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service is really liberated. Aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi: I am spirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman, spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything about transcendental activities.\nFour kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. But those who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. Only persons who perform activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness (m\u0101m \u0101\u015britya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to reach the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a planet. Such persons have no misgivings about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus they are factually Brahman.\nThose who are engaged in worshiping the form or arc\u0101 of the Lord, or who are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of Brahman, adhibh\u016bta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter."

            "purport": "Purport\nPersons acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness are never deviated from the path of entirely understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and at the time of death such a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can never forget K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\nThis Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person. The beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is association of persons who are K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.\nMany subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Param\u0101tm\u0101, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by his doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called d\u1e5b\u1e0dha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga, or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the substance of that conviction.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."
