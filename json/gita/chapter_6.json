            "purport": "Purport\nIn this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, the perfect yog\u012b.\nThe sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj\u00f1as (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog\u012b who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and thus he is the perfect sanny\u0101s\u012b, or perfect yog\u012b. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:\nna dhana\u1e41 na jana\u1e41 na sundar\u012b\u1e41kavit\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101 jagad-\u012b\u015ba k\u0101mayemama janmani janman\u012b\u015bvarebhavat\u0101d bhaktir ahaituk\u012b tvayi\n\u201cO Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth.\u201d"

            "purport": "Purport\nReal sanny\u0101sa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yog\u012bs who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is simultaneously a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga processes, is automatically served in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then j\u00f1\u0101na and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga. It may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts, namely j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The beginning of the ladder is called the yog\u0101ruruk\u1e63u stage, and the highest rung is called yog\u0101r\u016b\u1e0dha.\nConcerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.\nA K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, is situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And, being constantly engaged in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is considered to have ceased all material activities."

The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this.

As long as one\u2019s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Param\u0101tm\u0101. Real yoga practice entails meeting the Param\u0101tm\u0101 within the heart and then following His dictation.

Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical sam\u0101dhi, or absorption in the Supreme."

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. A directly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog\u012b are imperfectly K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\nNevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One should always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam\u0101dhi, or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.\nAll these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, because direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b characterizes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in this way:\nan\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101n, yath\u0101rham upayu\u00f1jata\u1e25nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandhe, yukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam ucyate\npr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25 parity\u0101govair\u0101gya\u1e41 phalgu kathyate\n\u201cWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.

As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yog\u012b."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe goal of life is to know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Param\u0101tm\u0101, the four-handed Vi\u1e63\u1e47u form. The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and not for any other purpose. The localized vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti is the plenary representation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a dwelling within one\u2019s heart. One who has no program to realize this vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of life, and the vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti situated in one\u2019s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this vi\u1e63\u1e47u-m\u016brti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yog\u012b. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya it is said:\nkarma\u1e47\u0101 manas\u0101 v\u0101c\u0101sarv\u0101vasth\u0101su sarvad\u0101sarvatra maithuna-ty\u0101gobrahmacarya\u1e41 pracak\u1e63ate\n\u201cThe vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind \u2013 at all times, under all circumstances and in all places.\u201d No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood, when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhy\u0101na, j\u00f1\u0101na or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having a sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called a brahmac\u0101r\u012b. Such a restrained householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the j\u00f1\u0101na and dhy\u0101na schools do not even admit householder brahmac\u0101r\u012bs. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.59) it is said:\nvi\u1e63ay\u0101 vinivartantenir\u0101h\u0101rasya dehina\u1e25rasa-varja\u1e41 raso \u2019py asyapara\u1e41 d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 nivartate\nWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.\nVigata-bh\u012b\u1e25. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.37) says, bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101d \u012b\u015b\u0101d apetasya viparyayo \u2019sm\u1e5bti\u1e25. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is already the best of all yog\u012bs. The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular so-called yoga societies."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yog\u012b according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Nor does cessation of material existence entail one\u2019s entering into \u201cthe void,\u201d which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma, or superior abodes.\nA consummate yog\u012b, who is perfect in understanding Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (mat-citta\u1e25, mat-para\u1e25, mat-sth\u0101nam), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) it is clearly stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25: the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha) or enter into the Lord\u2019s eternal abode (Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana) without the proper understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and His plenary expansion Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Therefore a person working in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the perfect yog\u012b, because his mind is always absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities (sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25). In the Vedas also (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8) we learn, tam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum eti: \u201cOne can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d In other words, perfection of the yoga system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people."

There is no need for men to eat animals, because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhu\u00f1jate te tv agha\u1e41 p\u0101p\u0101 ye pacanty \u0101tma-k\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101t. Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga. It is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, only the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice yoga. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. Such a person cannot perform yoga."

As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept pras\u0101dam, sanctified food. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is offered, according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. Avyartha-k\u0101latvam: a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord.

Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him."

Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcana, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general \u2013 especially those who are not in the renounced order of life \u2013 transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."

In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness, realized through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.",
            "purport": "Purport\nBy practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or sam\u0101dhi, which means that the yog\u012b realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Pata\u00f1jali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Pata\u00f1jali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Pata\u00f1jali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure \u2013 realized through transcendental senses \u2013 is accepted. And this is corroborated by Pata\u00f1jali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his Yoga-s\u016btras (4.33): puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-\u015b\u016bny\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pratiprasava\u1e25 kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti.\nThis citi-\u015bakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This \u201coneness with the Supreme\u201d is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pata\u00f1jali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpa\u1e47a-m\u0101rjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This \u201cclearance\u201d is actually liberation, or bhava-mah\u0101-d\u0101v\u0101gni-nirv\u0101pa\u1e47am. The theory of nirv\u0101\u1e47a \u2013 also preliminary \u2013 corresponds with this principle. In the Bh\u0101gavatam (2.10.6) this is called svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms this situation in this verse.\nAfter nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service to the Lord, known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In the words of the Bh\u0101gavatam, svar\u016bpe\u1e47a vyavasthiti\u1e25: this is the \u201creal life of the living entity.\u201d M\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pata\u00f1jali also accepts this by his words kaivalya\u1e41 svar\u016bpa-prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 citi-\u015baktir iti. This citi-\u015bakti, or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (1.1.12) as \u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nIn the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of sam\u0101dhi, called sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi and asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, he is said to have achieved sampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi. In the asampraj\u00f1\u0101ta-sam\u0101dhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yog\u012b is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yog\u012b is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today\u2019s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yog\u012b indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yog\u012bs who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If yog\u012bs are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.\nThe best practice of yoga in this age is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which is not baffling. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing ha\u1e6dha-yoga, dhy\u0101na-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.\nAs long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga, or in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences \u2013 such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative \u2013 but he is always alert to execute his duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (2.14), \u0101gam\u0101p\u0101yino \u2019nity\u0101s t\u0101\u1e41s titik\u1e63asva bh\u0101rata. He endures all such incidental occurrences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice."

A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu\u1e0da, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu\u1e0da was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garu\u1e0da at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu\u1e0da.\nSimilarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves."

The Lord in His Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The perfect yog\u012b knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see so clearly. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the heart of both the believer and the nonbeliever. In the sm\u1e5bti this is confirmed as follows: \u0101tatatv\u0101c ca m\u0101t\u1e5btv\u0101c ca \u0101tm\u0101 hi paramo hari\u1e25. The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the supreme father (or mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.\nOutwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies \u2013 the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord\u2019s energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another.\nThe yog\u012b sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in the spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

This is confirmed in the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.187) of \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b: nikhil\u0101sv apy avasth\u0101su j\u012bvan-mukta\u1e25 sa ucyate. A devotee of the Lord, always acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is automatically liberated. In the N\u0101rada Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra this is confirmed in this way:\ndik-k\u0101l\u0101dy-anavacchinnek\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e ceto vidh\u0101ya catan-mayo bhavati k\u1e63ipra\u1e41j\u012bvo brahma\u1e47i yojayet\n\u201cBy concentrating one\u2019s attention on the transcendental form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him.\u201d\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This very understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart makes the yog\u012b faultless. The Vedas (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21) confirm this inconceivable potency of the Lord as follows: eko \u2019pi san bahudh\u0101 yo \u2019vabh\u0101ti. \u201cAlthough the Lord is one, He is present in innumerable hearts as many.\u201d Similarly, in the sm\u1e5bti-\u015b\u0101stra it is said:\neka eva paro vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25sarva-vy\u0101p\u012b na sa\u1e41\u015baya\u1e25ai\u015bvary\u0101d r\u016bpam eka\u1e41 cas\u016brya-vat bahudheyate\n\u201cVi\u1e63\u1e47u is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading. By His inconceivable potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere, as the sun appears in many places at once.\u201d"

It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in this Age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by simple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and detachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was favorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better facilities than we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this Age of Kali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga system in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are certainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desired goal."

In the Vedic literature (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.3.3\u20134) it is said:\n\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 rathina\u1e41 viddhi\u015bar\u012bra\u1e41 ratham eva cabuddhi\u1e41 tu s\u0101rathi\u1e41 viddhimana\u1e25 pragraham eva ca\nindriy\u0101\u1e47i hay\u0101n \u0101hurvi\u1e63ay\u0101\u1e41s te\u1e63u gocar\u0101n\u0101tmendriya-mano-yukta\u1e41bhoktety \u0101hur man\u012b\u1e63i\u1e47a\u1e25\n\u201cThe individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and intelligence is the driver.

Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for a worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting \u201cHare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u201d the great mantra for deliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayo\u1e25: one must engage one\u2019s mind fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe the strict rules and regulations of placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn vair\u0101gya. Vair\u0101gya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is practical because by hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called pare\u015b\u0101nubhava, spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for many reasons. First of all, one may not be sufficiently serious about following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yog\u0101c calita-m\u0101nasa\u1e25: deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization."

If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The brahma\u1e47a\u1e25 pathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, who is manifested as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n.

On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.\u201d For material prospects there are many activities, both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One may argue that by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh\u0101gavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThe purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, certainly progress in life.\nThose who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate liberation from material existence, and (3) those who are devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life \u2013 even to the higher planets \u2013 but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate realization of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe word bhajate is significant here. Bhajate has its root in the verb bhaj, which is used when there is need of service. The English word \u201cworship\u201d cannot be used in the same sense as bhaj. Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The Bh\u0101gavatam (11.5.3) confirms this as follows:\nya e\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 puru\u1e63a\u1e41 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101d\u0101tma-prabhavam \u012b\u015bvaramna bhajanty avaj\u0101nantisth\u0101n\u0101d bhra\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25 patanty adha\u1e25\n\u201cAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.\u201d\nIn this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word \u201cworship\u201d can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word avaj\u0101nanti, used in this verse of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101\u1e25: \u201cOnly the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word \u201cworship.\u201d\nThe culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti yoga. All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. When j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga. And when one surpasses the a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog\u012b who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: karma-yog\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b or dhy\u0101na-yog\u012b, r\u0101ja-yog\u012b, ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other yogas. Therefore, to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Him\u0101layan, we refer to the world\u2019s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\nIt is by great fortune that one comes to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness on the path of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal yog\u012b concentrates his attention on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is called \u015ay\u0101masundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is flower-garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahma-jyotir. He incarnates in different forms such as R\u0101ma, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, Var\u0101ha and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of mother Ya\u015bod\u0101, and He is known as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Govinda and V\u0101sudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest yog\u012b.\nThis stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:\nyasya deve par\u0101 bhaktiryath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hy arth\u0101\u1e25prak\u0101\u015bante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\n\u201cOnly unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23)\nBhaktir asya bhajana\u1e41 tad ih\u0101mutrop\u0101dhi-nair\u0101syen\u0101mu\u1e63min mana\u1e25-kalpanam, etad eva nai\u1e63karmyam. \u201cBhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose of nai\u1e63karmya.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.15)\nThese are some of the means for performance of bhakti, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Dhy\u0101na-yoga."
