K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely explained in the last chapter.\n Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has such a great friend as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s divinity for all, he is requesting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has several times said: K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is speaking to him just for his benefit. So Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s grace. He is now convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supersoul."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on. Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person, Arjuna desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it. Arjuna\u2019s addressing the Lord as puru\u1e63ottama is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for Arjuna is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But the Lord can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others. Arjuna did not have any personal desire for confirmation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people."

But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s inestimable position. Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word yoge\u015bvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He does not give K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not obliged to reveal Himself unless one surrenders fully in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "purport": "Purport\nA pure devotee does not like to see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not very important; that will be clear in subsequent verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.\nDevotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the friends of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the parents of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a never want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam it is stated that the boys who play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Such boys do not know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. Therefore \u015aukadeva Gosv\u0101m\u012b recites this verse:\nittha\u1e41 sat\u0101\u1e41 brahma-sukh\u0101nubh\u016bty\u0101d\u0101sya\u1e41 gat\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 para-daivatenam\u0101y\u0101\u015brit\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 nara-d\u0101rake\u1e47as\u0101ka\u1e41 vijahru\u1e25 k\u1e5bta-pu\u1e47ya-pu\u00f1j\u0101\u1e25\n\u201cHere is the Supreme Person, who is considered the impersonal Brahman by great sages, the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotees, and a product of material nature by ordinary men. Now these boys, who have performed many, many pious activities in their past lives, are playing with that Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (\u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam 10.12.11)\nThe fact is that the devotee is not concerned with seeing the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s statements so that in the future people could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar\u0101 system. Those who are actually interested in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.\nThe Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already explained."

As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these.

He is praising the universal form. Thus Arjuna\u2019s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the reservoir of all relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.\nHere Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way."

Except for a few P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, everyone who was present on that battlefield would be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that was His plan. If Arjuna stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death could not be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature."

This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of \u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cmaybe.\u201d There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long as they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight in accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and his life is devoted to the Lord\u2019s transcendental service, he is perfect."

Arjuna is addressing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as mah\u0101tm\u0101, which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deve\u015ba means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the shelter of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him, because no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is greater than Brahm\u0101 because Brahm\u0101 is created by Him. Brahm\u0101 is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodaka-\u015b\u0101y\u012b Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plenary expansion; therefore Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva, who is born of Brahm\u0101, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. It is stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that the Lord is respected by Lord \u015aiva and Brahm\u0101 and similar other demigods. The word ak\u1e63aram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\u0101 and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Without being a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.\nThe Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because no one is equal to or higher than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him. This is stated in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (6.8):\nna tasya k\u0101rya\u1e41 kara\u1e47a\u1e41 ca vidyatena tat-sama\u015b c\u0101bhyadhika\u015b ca d\u1e5b\u015byate\nThe Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, His body, His mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not perfectly know Him say that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that although He does not have senses like ours, He can perform all sensory activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.\nThe knowledge, strength and activities of the Supreme Personality are all transcendental. As stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (4.9):\njanma karma ca me divyameva\u1e41 yo vetti tattvata\u1e25tyaktv\u0101 deha\u1e41 punar janmanaiti m\u0101m eti so \u2019rjuna\nWhoever knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn\u2019t come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; everyone is His servant. The Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (\u0100di 5.142) confirms, ekale \u012b\u015bvara k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, \u0101ra saba bh\u1e5btya: only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is God, and everyone else is His servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His superintendence. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, He is the cause of all causes."

But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to show His N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a form, because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets. Of course in each Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planet the form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a is four-handed, but the four hands hold different arrangements of symbols \u2013 the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four things are held in, the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47as are variously named. All of these forms are one with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are demigods (vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhakta\u1e25 sm\u1e5bto daiva\u1e25). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or who recognize only the impersonal part of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 gives the description of the universal form. Although this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have some idea of the vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa after this incident. Those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested in seeing the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.\nIn this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yaj\u00f1\u0101dhyayanai\u1e25, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, such as the four Vedas (\u1e5ag, Yajur, S\u0101ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur\u0101\u1e47as, the Upani\u1e63ads and the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are s\u016btras \u2013 Kalpa-s\u016btras and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101-s\u016btras \u2013 for studying the method of sacrifice. D\u0101nai\u1e25 refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord \u2013 the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the Vai\u1e63\u1e47avas. Similarly, \u201cpious activities\u201d refers to the agni-hotra and the prescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains is called tapasya. So one can perform all these \u2013 can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc. \u2013 but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.\nThere are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables one to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations."

But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather.

K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. Either a devotee wants to offer his respectful worshipful feelings, or he wants to see the two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form so that he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

            "purport": "Purport\nIn the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many pious activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word su-durdar\u015bam is used, indicating that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahm\u0101 and Lord \u015aiva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidence in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devak\u012b, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was not at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to Him but to the impersonal \u201csomething\u201d within Him, but these are all nonsensical postures. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His two-armed form is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva.\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (9.11) it is also confirmed, avaj\u0101nanti m\u0101\u1e41 m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 m\u0101nu\u1e63\u012b\u1e41 tanum \u0101\u015britam: He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s body, as confirmed by Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 and confirmed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by reading Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a problem. For one using a material process, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He was so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Chapter Four: to hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in the Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as \u015ay\u0101masundara."

            "purport": "Purport\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to understand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on Janm\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dam\u012b, the day on which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a appeared, and on the two days of Ek\u0101da\u015b\u012b (the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a philosophy, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, throughout the world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b as the most munificent man of charity because love of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, that charity, given to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.23):\nyasya deve par\u0101 bhaktiryath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hy arth\u0101\u1e25prak\u0101\u015bante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\nOne who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThe personal forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described as su-durdar\u015bam, very difficult to see. They are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The words tvad anyena na d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da-p\u016brvam (verse 47) state that before Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.\nThe word na, used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the origin of all emanations. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (which is known as Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.48),\nyasyaika-ni\u015bvasita-k\u0101lam ath\u0101valambyaj\u012bvanti loma-vila-j\u0101 jagad-a\u1e47\u1e0da-n\u0101th\u0101\u1e25vi\u1e63\u1e47ur mah\u0101n sa iha yasya kal\u0101-vi\u015be\u1e63ogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63a\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi\n\u201cThe Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, into whom all the innumerable universes enter and from whom they come forth again simply by His breathing process, is a plenary expansion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore I worship Govinda, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the cause of all causes.\u201d Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nIn the Vedic literature (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.1) the following statement appears:\nsac-cid-\u0101nanda-r\u016bp\u0101yak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101y\u0101kli\u1e63\u1e6da-k\u0101ri\u1e47enamo ved\u0101nta-vedy\u0101yagurave buddhi-s\u0101k\u1e63i\u1e47e\n\u201cI offer my respectful obeisances unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has a transcendental form of bliss, eternity and knowledge. I offer my respect to Him, because understanding Him means understanding the Vedas, and He is therefore the supreme spiritual master.\u201d Then it is said, k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o vai parama\u1e41 daivatam: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.3) Eko va\u015b\u012b sarva-ga\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u012b\u1e0dya\u1e25: \u201cThat one K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is worshipable.\u201d Eko \u2019pi san bahudh\u0101 yo \u2019vabh\u0101ti: \u201cK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is one, but He is manifested in unlimited forms and expanded incarnations.\u201d (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21)\nThe Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.1) says,\n\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am\n\u201cThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who has a body of eternity, knowledge and bliss. He has no beginning, for He is the beginning of everything. He is the cause of all causes.\u201d\nElsewhere it is said, yatr\u0101vat\u012br\u1e47a\u1e41 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101khya\u1e41 para\u1e41 brahma nar\u0101k\u1e5bti: \u201cThe Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He sometimes descends on this earth.\u201d Similarly, in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in this list the name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a also appears. But then it is said that this K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (ete c\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam).\nSimilarly, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat: \u201cThere is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, aham \u0101dir hi dev\u0101n\u0101m: \u201cI am the origin of all the demigods.\u201d And after understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\u1e41 brahma para\u1e41 dh\u0101ma pavitra\u1e41 parama\u1e41 bhav\u0101n, \u201cI now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.\u201d Therefore the universal form which K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God\u2019s original form.\nThe universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the most dear."

Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.\nAs far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities. As stated in the Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.255),\nan\u0101saktasya vi\u1e63ay\u0101nyath\u0101rham upayu\u00f1jata\u1e25nirbandha\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-sambandheyukta\u1e41 vair\u0101gyam ucyate\nNo work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is called k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one has to do business for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of the business, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can do it. This is work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can install the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and arrange for the Deity\u2019s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept as pras\u0101dam the remnants of offerings to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one constructs a very big building for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and installs the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; that is also k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land \u2013 in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land \u2013 can utilize that for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow tulas\u012b plants, because tulas\u012b leaves are very important and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has recommended this in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63pa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toyam. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water \u2013 and by such an offering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulas\u012b. So one can sow tulas\u012b and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nThe word mat-parama\u1e25 refers to one who considers the association of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahma-jyotir effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta\u1e25, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.\nThe term sa\u1e45ga-varjita\u1e25 is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Not only are the atheistic persons against K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.1.11) as follows:\nany\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63it\u0101-\u015b\u016bnya\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101na-karm\u0101dy-an\u0101v\u1e5btam\u0101nuk\u016blyena k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101nu-\u015b\u012blana\u1e41 bhaktir uttam\u0101\nIn this verse \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, that is called pure devotional service. \u0100nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kalpa\u1e25 pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanam (Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa 11.676). One should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and act for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a favorably, not unfavorably. Ka\u1e41sa was an enemy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s. From the very beginning of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s birth, Ka\u1e41sa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious in every respect, but that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana. His only objective is to serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wherever he may be.\nA devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy (nirvaira\u1e25). How is this? A devotee situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows that only devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as \u1e6ch\u0101kura Harid\u0101sa and Prahl\u0101da Mah\u0101r\u0101ja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one\u2019s neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.\nIn summary, the universal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is a manifestation of the original vi\u015bva-r\u016bpa, or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi\u1e63\u1e47us, but for a devotee no form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is important but the original form, two-handed \u015ay\u0101masundara. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is stated that those who are attached to the \u015ay\u0101masundara form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is essential and supreme.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Universal Form."
