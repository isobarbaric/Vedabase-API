            "purport": "Purport\n\u201cLord of sacrifice\u201d may refer to either Indra or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the chief of the primal demigods, including Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva, and Indra is the chief of the administrative demigods. Both Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are worshiped by yaj\u00f1a performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity.\nArjuna addresses the Lord as Madhus\u016bdana because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a once killed a demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhus\u016bdana so that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna\u2019s mind.\nNow the word pray\u0101\u1e47a-k\u0101le in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. What should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. Thus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the Supreme Lord. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara, a great devotee, prays, \u201cMy dear Lord, just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet.\u201d The metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in digging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower. Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kula\u015bekhara says to the Lord, \u201cNow my mind is undisturbed, and I am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But if I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, because at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name. Better let me die immediately.\u201d Arjuna questions how a person can fix his mind on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s lotus feet at such a time."

            "purport": "Purport\nBrahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Para-brahman. Brahman refers to the living entity, and Para-brahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.\nIn Vedic literature the living entity is called j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 and Brahman, but he is never called Para-brahman. The living entity (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) takes different positions \u2013 sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior, spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord\u2019s marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yaj\u00f1a), but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process is called karma.\nThe Ch\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63ad describes the Vedic sacrificial process. On the sacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings are made into five kinds of fire. The five kinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man and woman, and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on the moon, rain, grains and semen.\nIn the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.\nImpersonalist commentators on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of j\u012bva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the G\u012bt\u0101. But in this verse the Lord also speaks of the living entity as \u201can eternal fragment of Myself.\u201d The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of j\u012bva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Para-brahman (the Supreme Lord)."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical nature is called adhibh\u016bta. It is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point. The conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord, which includes all the demigods and their different planets, is called adhidaivata. And present in the body along with the individual soul is the Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Supersoul is called the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or adhiyaj\u00f1a and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul\u2019s activities and is the source of the soul\u2019s various types of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity to act freely and witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service to the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivata is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form, or vir\u0101\u1e6d-puru\u1e63a, whose legs are considered the lower planets, whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper planetary system."

This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Bharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one\u2019s thoughts during the course of one\u2019s life accumulate to influence one\u2019s thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one\u2019s next life. If in one\u2019s present life one lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it is possible for one to remember K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the end of one\u2019s life.

If one is transcendentally absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material.

One\u2019s memory of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is revived by chanting the mah\u0101-mantra, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one\u2019s ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puru\u1e63am means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101sudeva, etc.\nThe devotee can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in any of His features \u2013 N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, etc. \u2013 by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

One cannot meditate on something impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord is puru\u1e63a, a person \u2013 we think of the person R\u0101ma and the person K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And whether one thinks of R\u0101ma or of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, what He is like is described in this verse of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The Lord is kavi; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (\u201cinconceivable\u201d) is very significant in this connection. God\u2019s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world \u2013 so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding."

Taking it for granted that Arjuna might not know how to practice \u1e63a\u1e6d-cakra-yoga, the Lord explains the process in the following verses. The Lord says that Brahman, although one without a second, has various manifestations and features. Especially for the impersonalists, the ak\u1e63ara, or o\u1e41-k\u0101ra \u2013 the syllable o\u1e41 \u2013 is identical with Brahman. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a here explains the impersonal Brahman, into which the renounced order of sages enter.\nIn the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate o\u1e41 and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman\u2019s features. This practice is very essential for the student\u2019s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmac\u0101r\u012b (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one\u2019s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in this age no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy names of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

            "purport": "Purport\nThis verse especially describes the final destination attained by the unalloyed devotees who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in bhakti-yoga. Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of devotees \u2013 the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been described: karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and ha\u1e6dha-yoga. The principles of these yoga systems have some bhakti added, but this verse particularly mentions pure bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of j\u00f1\u0101na, karma or ha\u1e6dha. As indicated by the word ananya-cet\u0101\u1e25, in pure bhakti-yoga the devotee desires nothing but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the brahma-jyotir or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta the pure devotee is called ni\u1e63k\u0101ma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012b, karma-yog\u012b or ha\u1e6dha-yog\u012b has his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.\nA pure devotee always engages in devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in one of His various personal features. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as R\u0101ma and N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha, and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those who always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As stated in the Vedas (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.23), yam evai\u1e63a v\u1e5b\u1e47ute tena labhyas/ tasyai\u1e63a \u0101tm\u0101 viv\u1e5b\u1e47ute tanu\u1e41 sv\u0101m: one who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (10.10), dad\u0101mi buddhi-yoga\u1e41 tam: the Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.\nThe special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana by his devotional service. It was \u015ar\u012b Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, \u201cWherever You are, O Lord \u2013 there is V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana.\u201d\nAs indicated by the words satatam and nitya\u015ba\u1e25, which mean \u201calways,\u201d \u201cregularly,\u201d or \u201cevery day,\u201d a pure devotee constantly remembers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee, for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the G\u012bt\u0101 recommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yog\u012bs are engaged in five different ways: (1) \u015b\u0101nta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2) d\u0101sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; (3) sakhya-bhakta, engaged as friend; (4) v\u0101tsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and (5) m\u0101dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious process of chanting the mah\u0101-mantra \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare."

The mah\u0101tm\u0101s receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s association, and nothing else. That is the highest perfection of life. This verse specifically mentions the personalist devotees of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. These devotees in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness achieve the highest perfection of life. In other words, they are the supreme souls."

A kalpa is a day of Brahm\u0101, and one day of Brahm\u0101 consists of a thousand cycles of four yugas, or ages: Satya, Tret\u0101, Dv\u0101para and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tret\u0101-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dv\u0101para-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki avat\u0101ra, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahm\u0101, and the same number comprise one night. Brahm\u0101 lives one hundred of such \u201cyears\u201d and then dies. These \u201chundred years\u201d by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 billion earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahm\u0101 seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the Causal Ocean there are innumerable Brahm\u0101s rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. Brahm\u0101 and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.\nIn the material universe not even Brahm\u0101 is free from the process of birth, old age, disease and death. Brahm\u0101, however, is directly engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe \u2013 therefore he at once attains liberation. Elevated sanny\u0101s\u012bs are promoted to Brahm\u0101\u2019s particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and which survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course Brahm\u0101 and all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of material nature."

The supreme abode of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, known as Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees, called \u201cdesire trees,\u201d that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows, known as surabhi cows, which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak\u1e63m\u012bs), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (ve\u1e47u\u1e41 kva\u1e47antam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds \u2013 His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His body is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a gives only a small hint of His personal abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Vedic literatures (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.3.11) state that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination (puru\u1e63\u0101n na para\u1e41 ki\u00f1cit s\u0101 k\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101 param\u0101 gati\u1e25). When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth, V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana located in the spiritual sky. When K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, comprising about 168 square miles in the district of Mathur\u0101, India."

The Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 describes this supreme abode as \u0101nanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss \u2013 nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere \u2013 both in the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasy\u0101nta\u1e25-sth\u0101ni means that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.\nTo enter K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme abode or the innumerable Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets is possible only by bhakti, devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the word bhakty\u0101. No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The Vedas (Gop\u0101la-t\u0101pan\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 1.21) also describe the supreme abode and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Eko va\u015b\u012b sarva-ga\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25. In that abode there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The Vedas compare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits, flowers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside over the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of names \u2013 Puru\u1e63ottama, Trivikrama, Ke\u015bava, M\u0101dhava, Aniruddha, H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, Sa\u1e45kar\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pradyumna, \u015ar\u012bdhara, V\u0101sudeva, D\u0101modara, Jan\u0101rdana, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, V\u0101mana, Padman\u0101bha, etc.\nThe Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) also confirms that although the Lord is always in the supreme abode, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, He is all-pervading, so that everything is going on nicely (goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25). As stated in the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.8), par\u0101sya \u015baktir vividhaiva \u015br\u016byate/ sv\u0101bh\u0101vik\u012b j\u00f1\u0101na-bala-kriy\u0101 ca: His energies are so expansive that they systematically conduct everything in the cosmic manifestation without a flaw, although the Supreme Lord is far, far away."

            "purport": "Purport\nThis verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth chapters, which particularly deal with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\u0101r\u012b has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master\u2019s order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya.\nAfter the student studies the Vedas under the master for some time \u2013 at least from age five to twenty \u2013 he becomes a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the brahmac\u0101r\u012b is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many sacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give charity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of v\u0101naprastha, he undergoes severe penances \u2013 living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmacarya, householder life, v\u0101naprastha and finally sanny\u0101sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahma-jyotir or in the Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha planets or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47aloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.\nThe beauty of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life.\nThe words ida\u1e41 viditv\u0101 indicate that one should understand the instructions given by \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees. Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which are especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2013 especially these middle six chapters \u2013 in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nOne who has a little faith in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One should therefore learn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not from mental speculators. This is a sign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee\u2019s association one actually begins to study and understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service, and this service dispels all one\u2019s misgivings about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or God, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one\u2019s study. Then one relishes the study of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and attains the state of feeling always K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Attaining the Supreme."
