The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: This body, O son of Kunt\u012b, is called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.",
            "purport": "Purport\nArjuna was inquisitive about prak\u1e5bti (nature), puru\u1e63a (the enjoyer), k\u1e63etra (the field), k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a (its knower), and knowledge and the object of knowledge. When he inquired about all these, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord it over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called k\u1e63etra, or the field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person, who should not identify himself with the body, is called k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning \u2013 dehino \u2019smin \u2013 that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is distinctly k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a. Sometimes we think, \u201cI am happy,\u201d \u201cI am a man,\u201d \u201cI am a woman,\u201d \u201cI am a dog,\u201d \u201cI am a cat.\u201d These are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different from the body. Although we may use many articles \u2013 our clothes, etc. \u2013 we know that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body. I or you or anyone else who owns the body is called k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, the knower of the field of activities, and the body is called k\u1e63etra, the field of activities itself.\nIn the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the knower of the body (the living entity) and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are described. In the middle six chapters of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different capacities \u2013 as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material nature and how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from the material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained."

            "purport": "Purport\nWhile discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says, \u201cI am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, or Supersoul.\u201d\nOne who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, can attain to knowledge.\nThe Lord says, \u201cI am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.\u201d The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.\nThe body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, which means \u201cthe controller of the senses.\u201d He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord says, \u201cI am also the knower.\u201d This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:\nk\u1e63etr\u0101\u1e47i hi \u015bar\u012br\u0101\u1e47ib\u012bja\u1e41 c\u0101pi \u015bubh\u0101\u015bubhet\u0101ni vetti sa yog\u0101tm\u0101tata\u1e25 k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a ucyate\nThis body is called the k\u1e63etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as j\u00f1\u0101na. That is the opinion of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak\u1e5bti (nature), puru\u1e63a (the enjoyer of nature) and \u012b\u015bvara (the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language (in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 1.12), bhokt\u0101 bhogya\u1e41 prerit\u0101ra\u1e41 ca matv\u0101/ sarva\u1e41 prokta\u1e41 tri-vidha\u1e41 brahmam etat. There are three Brahman conceptions: prak\u1e5bti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the j\u012bva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.\nIn this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly, \u201cI am also the knower of the field of activity.\u201d One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul. And K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a explicitly says here that real knowledge is to know that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the Ved\u0101nta, which is accepted as authority. First He says, \u201cThis is according to different sages.\u201d As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy\u0101sadeva (the author of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra) is a great sage, and in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra duality is perfectly explained. And Vy\u0101sadeva\u2019s father, Par\u0101\u015bara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity, aham tva\u1e41 ca tath\u0101nye.\u2026 \u201cwe \u2013 you, I and the various other living entities \u2013 are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\u201d Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad. There are many great sages who have explained this, and Par\u0101\u015bara is considered principal among them.\nThe word chandobhi\u1e25 refers to the various Vedic literatures. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad, for example, which is a branch of the Yajur Veda, describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nAs stated before, k\u1e63etra is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a: the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63ad (2.5), brahma puccha\u1e41 prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101. There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\u2019s energy known as anna-maya, dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, in pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In j\u00f1\u0101na-maya, realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, in which the living entity\u2019s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is \u0101nanda-maya, realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are called brahma puccham. Out of these, the first three \u2013 anna-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya and j\u00f1\u0101na-maya \u2013 involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called \u0101nanda-maya. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra also describes the Supreme by saying, \u0101nanda-mayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij\u00f1\u0101na-maya, pr\u0101\u1e47a-maya, j\u00f1\u0101na-maya and anna-maya. In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the \u0101nanda-maya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the \u0101nanda-maya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, or Brahma-s\u016btra.\nIt is mentioned here that the codes of the Brahma-s\u016btra are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect. Some of the s\u016btras, or aphorisms, are na viyad a\u015brute\u1e25 (2.3.2), n\u0101tm\u0101 \u015brute\u1e25 (2.3.18), and par\u0101t tu tac-chrute\u1e25 (2.3.40). The first aphorism indicates the field of activities, the second indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the summum bonum among all the manifestations of various entities."

            "purport": "Purport\nFrom all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and the aphorisms of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, the components of this world can be understood as follows. First there are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (mah\u0101-bh\u016bta). Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, anus and genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, form, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity. Then there are desire, hatred, happiness and distress, which are interactions, representations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness, and convictions are the manifestation of the subtle body \u2013 mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included within the field of activities.\nThe five great elements are a gross representation of the false ego, which in turn represents the primal stage of false ego technically called the materialistic conception, or t\u0101masa-buddhi, intelligence in ignorance. This, further, represents the unmanifested stage of the three modes of material nature. The unmanifested modes of material nature are called pradh\u0101na.\nOne who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, a summary only is given.\nThe body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it produces by-products, then it begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes. Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the k\u1e63etra-j\u00f1a, the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different."

            "purport": "Purport\nThis process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the twenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out of the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the body, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the eleventh verse. Mayi c\u0101nanya-yogena bhaktir avyabhic\u0101ri\u1e47\u012b: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But if one takes to devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.18.12), yasy\u0101sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\u00f1can\u0101 sarvair gu\u1e47ais tatra sam\u0101sate sur\u0101\u1e25. All the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essential. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.\nAs for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows. Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge \u2013 who knows that he is not this body \u2013 anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.\nNonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement. That is nonviolence.\nTolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahl\u0101da, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahl\u0101da tolerated him. So there may be many impediments to making advancement in spiritual knowledge, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.\nSimplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple\u2019s following the regulative principles. Or, the regulative principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.\nCleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness one has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a always and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.\nSteadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress. And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That will control the eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is simply expounding the science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole objective. Unintelligent commentators on the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 than devotional service.\nFalse ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, he comes to his real ego. Ego is there. False ego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature (B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad 1.4.10) it is said, aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi: I am Brahman, I am spirit. This \u201cI am,\u201d the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of \u201cI am\u201d is ego, but when the sense of \u201cI am\u201d is applied to this false body it is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego, because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam the world of the unborn, the child\u2019s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life.\nAs for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection. But when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. If one is in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he can make his home very happy, because this process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four things will make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned. One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as Arjuna did. Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a realization, he accepted the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life, because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable.\nHappiness and distress are concomitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equipoised in both cases. Generally, when we get something desirable we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable we are distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position these things will not agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service. Devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service \u2013 chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc. \u2013 as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed.\nNaturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place, without unwanted association. Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 such research work and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one should make research, by philosophical discretion, into the nature of the soul. One should make research to understand the self. That is recommended here.\nAs far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as it is clearly stated. So bhakti, or devotional service, is eternal. One should be established in that philosophical conviction.\nIn the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11) this is explained. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam. \u201cThose who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d Bhagav\u0101n is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That is the perfection of knowledge.\nBeginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor and going up to the top floor. Now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or the third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility, understanding is not truly possible. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, he still thinks, \u201cI am God\u201d because of ignorance. The beginning of knowledge, therefore, is am\u0101nitva, humility. One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature. One must know and be convinced of this truth."

Now He begins to explain the knowable, first the soul and then the Supersoul. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the j\u012bva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101\u2019s manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this: na j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcit (Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad 1.2.18). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge.\nThe Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.16) to be pradh\u0101na-k\u1e63etraj\u00f1a-patir gu\u1e47e\u015ba\u1e25, the chief knower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature.

This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings. Therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is vij\u00f1\u0101na-brahma as opposed to \u0101nanda-brahma. \u0100nanda-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead."

He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great teacher, Brahm\u0101, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 (5.37) it is stated, goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016bta\u1e25: although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading. Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not the individual soul."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities, doesn\u2019t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in conditioned life they are covered with the material elements, and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter. The Supreme Lord\u2019s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirgu\u1e47a. Gu\u1e47a means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.19) in the verse ap\u0101\u1e47i-p\u0101do javano grah\u012bt\u0101. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes \u2013 otherwise how could He see? He sees everything \u2013 past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101: He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.\nBhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy, because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form, called sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can see the Lord\u2019s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists, who are still materially affected, cannot understand the Personality of Godhead."

In the material world that brahma-jyotir, the Lord\u2019s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world, which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. \u0100ditya-var\u1e47a\u1e41 tamasa\u1e25 parast\u0101t (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8). He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world.\nHis knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord, who is situated in everyone\u2019s heart. One Vedic mantra (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.18) says, ta\u1e41 ha devam \u0101tma-buddhi-prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e41 mumuk\u1e63ur vai \u015bara\u1e47am aha\u1e41 prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned, it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditv\u0101ti m\u1e5btyum eti. \u201cOnly by knowing Him can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.\u201d (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 3.8)\nHe is situated in everyone\u2019s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity \u2013 the individual soul and the Supersoul \u2013 must be admitted. One\u2019s hands and legs are distributed locally, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (3.17): sarvasya prabhum \u012b\u015b\u0101na\u1e41 sarvasya \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 b\u1e5bhat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu, or master, of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different."

Combined, these are called vij\u00f1\u0101na, or the science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s activities and realize that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained.\nNow, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7, beginning from mah\u0101-bh\u016bt\u0101ni and continuing through cetan\u0101 dh\u1e5bti\u1e25, analyze the material elements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to form the body, or the field of activities. And verses 8 through 12, from am\u0101nitvam through tattva-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha-dar\u015banam, describe the process of knowledge for understanding both types of knower of the field of activities, namely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18, beginning from an\u0101di mat-param and continuing through h\u1e5bdi sarvasya vi\u1e63\u1e6dhitam, describe the soul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul.\nThus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the process of understanding, and both the soul and the Supersoul. It is especially described here that only the unalloyed devotees of the Lord can understand these three items clearly. So for these devotees Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is fully useful; it is they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In other words, only devotees, and not others, can understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and derive the desired result."

The body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature. The individual soul that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the body is the puru\u1e63a, or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion.\nBoth material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities are of the superior energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of the mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are averse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But with the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the same."

There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are creations of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total \u2013 body and instrument senses \u2013 is offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one\u2019s desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas (Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad 3.1.1) as follows: dv\u0101 supar\u1e47\u0101 sayuj\u0101 sakh\u0101ya\u1e25. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul, or Param\u0101tm\u0101."

            "purport": "Purport\nThis verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.\nHow he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Unless one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life."

Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the Param\u0101tm\u0101 in every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para, transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name is Param\u0101tm\u0101, not \u0101tm\u0101, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that the \u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101 are different. The Supersoul, the Param\u0101tm\u0101, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul\u2019s desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhukta, or the sustained, and the Lord is bhokt\u0101, or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend.\nThe fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has this tendency he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and from within He tries to convince the living entity that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness. \u201cJust give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy,\u201d He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the Param\u0101tm\u0101 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge."

Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding. But there are others, who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called introspective devotees, philosophers, and workers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are best situated in spiritual understanding, because they understand that beyond this material nature are the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is expanded as the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the class of the faithful. The S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate the ha\u1e6dha-yoga system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities."

Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home."

Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun. When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body there is no more consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a product of the combinations of matter. It is the symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme, because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness."

Then one can go on to the supreme destination.\nA faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, one can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the stepping-stone for further spiritual realization. A spiritual master, by various instructions, teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life. For instance, in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we find K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations.\nOne can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its twenty-four elements. The body is the gross manifestation. And the subtle manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and can also see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness."
