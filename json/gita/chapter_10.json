            "purport": "Purport\nThe word bhagav\u0101n is explained thus by Par\u0101\u015bara Muni: one who is full in six opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation, is Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages like Par\u0101\u015bara Muni have all accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has already explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter He has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.\nThe more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of devotees; that will enhance one\u2019s devotional service. Discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because Arjuna is very dear to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place."

Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful, uncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by such foolish speculation.\nHere the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, \u201cHere I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.\u201d One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. The conception of God as some ruling power or as the impersonal Brahman can be reached by persons who are in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.\nBecause most men cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord\u2019s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a they can understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is \u0101tm\u0101, what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship."

            "purport": "Purport\nAs stated in the Seventh Chapter (7.3), manu\u1e63y\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 sahasre\u1e63u ka\u015bcid yatati siddhaye: those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men; they are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization. But out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.\nHere the Lord is described by the word aja, meaning \u201cunborn,\u201d but He is distinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as aja. The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment. The conditioned souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior, material energy, but is always in the superior energy.\nIn this verse the words vetti loka-mahe\u015bvaram indicate that one should know that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the universe. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is different even from the great demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva. And because He is the creator of Brahm\u0101, \u015aiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets.\n\u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nOne should not try to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a human being. As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.\nIf K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is known as the son of Devak\u012b, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam: When He appeared before Devak\u012b and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.\nAnything done under the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental. It cannot be contaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends on activities in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam and Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sanny\u0101sa. As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his activities (an\u0101\u015brita\u1e25 karma-phalam), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sanny\u0101s\u012b and a yog\u012b, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or a pseudo yog\u012b."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they are described here.\nIntelligence refers to the power to analyze things in their proper perspective, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.\nAsammoha, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. K\u1e63am\u0101, tolerance and forgiveness, should be practiced; one should be tolerant and excuse the minor offenses of others. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are, for the benefit of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straightforward way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.\nControl of the senses means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal enjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use. Similarly, one should restrain the mind from unnecessary thoughts; that is called \u015bama. One should not spend one\u2019s time pondering over earning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented authoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. And similarly, that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected.\nBhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Birth and death apply to one\u2019s embodiment in the material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright. Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and be situated always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. In that way we will be free from all fear. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (11.2.37) it is stated, bhaya\u1e41 dvit\u012by\u0101bhinive\u015bata\u1e25 sy\u0101t: fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy. But those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Abhayam, fearlessness, is possible only for one in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so many politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.\nSamat\u0101, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. That which is favorable for prosecuting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samat\u0101, equanimity. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept save in terms of its usefulness in the prosecution of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nTu\u1e63\u1e6di, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and regulations in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles when they are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.\nAs far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but the best cause. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. According to the Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman. Brahma j\u0101n\u0101t\u012bti br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u1e25: one who knows Brahman is called a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. Thus charity is offered to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as because they are always engaged in higher spiritual service and have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to one in the renounced order of life, the sanny\u0101s\u012b. The sanny\u0101s\u012bs beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life \u2013 awakening their K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness \u2013 it is the business of the sanny\u0101s\u012bs to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sanny\u0101s\u012bs; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.\nYa\u015bas, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a great man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One who does not have such fame is infamous.\nAll these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a creates all these qualities, but the person develops them himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.\nOf whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nothing can manifest itself in this material world which is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is knowledge; although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and proceed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with determination and firmness."

Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.\nIn the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahma-jyotir effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V\u1e5bnd\u0101vana, the supreme planet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya-l\u012bl\u0101, Chapter Nineteen). It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.\nThe \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is also full of such narrations about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the Bh\u0101gavatam itself (12.13.18). \u015ar\u012bmad-bh\u0101gavata\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47am amala\u1e41 yad vai\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 priyam. In this narration there is nothing about material activities, economic development, sense gratification or liberation. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association."

We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yoga itself is action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yoga. In other words, buddhi-yoga is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.\nWhen a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is acting in j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a completely in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life.\nA person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but if he is still not intelligent enough to make progress, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the path of self-realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him."

            "purport": "Purport\nWhen Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.\nThe Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within his heart; and with the presence of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance is at once dissipated. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nDue to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one\u2019s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the material necessities of life; he need not be anxious, because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. By studying Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, one can become a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors."

Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, \u201cYou are para\u1e41 brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d And previously K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stated that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This has already been explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is Arjuna\u2019s intimate friend Arjuna is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.\n In the Kena Upani\u1e63ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has already explained that everything is resting on Him. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is smara\u1e47am, one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.\nIn the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna\u2019s acceptance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom N\u0101rada is the chief.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one\u2019s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the supreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Pur\u0101\u1e47as and histories. In all Vedic literatures K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, \u201cAlthough I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.\u201d He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.\nHere Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If we want to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the parampar\u0101 system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is an ordinary person."

By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampar\u0101 system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was lost, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to G\u012btopani\u1e63ad, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 should be understood in the parampar\u0101 system. When the parampar\u0101 system was lost, Arjuna was selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance by Arjuna of all that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and then only can we understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and since it is the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, it should be understood from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons.\n As stated in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11):\nvadanti tat tattva-vidastattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayambrahmeti param\u0101tmetibhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate\nThe Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 may not understand God\u2019s personality. Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the Supreme Person from the verses of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, which are being spoken by this person, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Bhagav\u0101n, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Puru\u1e63ottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru\u1e63ottama. Yet one still may not understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bh\u016bta-bh\u0101vana. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bh\u016bte\u015ba, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Deva-deva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagat-pati. Thus the truth about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as He is."

Now Arjuna is convinced that his friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. Common men, including the demons and atheists, cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He is guarded by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord.

The common man who has no love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he has to think materially.

And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. The Pur\u0101\u1e47as are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings."

Rather, the very topics of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are so relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar. Thus the devotees enjoy them. In discussing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies. The word pr\u0101dh\u0101nyata\u1e25 (\u201cprincipal\u201d) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And vibh\u016bti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In the Amara-ko\u015ba dictionary it is stated that vibh\u016bti indicates an exceptional opulence.\nThe impersonalist or pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energies. Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way."

Thus this address by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a first informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the puru\u1e63a incarnation, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is \u0101tm\u0101, the soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation; actually the Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy. He is the soul. When Mah\u0101-vi\u1e63\u1e47u enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, enters.

The S\u0101ma Veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods. One of these songs is the B\u1e5bhat-s\u0101ma, which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight.\nIn Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry, the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified br\u0101hma\u1e47as, is the most prominent. The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is mentioned in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. Because the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra. The G\u0101yatr\u012b mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman. Brahm\u0101 is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession.\n The month of November-December is considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time and the people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahm\u0101, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.\nThere is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahm\u0101 and \u015aiva represent only part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is asamaurdhva, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in the same category with demigods \u2013 be they even Brahm\u0101 or \u015aiva \u2013 becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and can fix his mind in the worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses 8 through 11. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter. \u015ar\u012bla Baladeva Vidy\u0101bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, a great \u0101c\u0101rya in disciplic succession from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,\nyac-chakti-le\u015b\u0101t s\u016bry\u0101dy\u0101bhavanty aty-ugra-tejasa\u1e25yad-a\u1e41\u015bena dh\u1e5bta\u1e41 vi\u015bva\u1e41sa k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47o da\u015bame \u2019rcyate\nFrom Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power, and by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s partial expansion the whole world is maintained. Therefore Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is worshipable.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute."
