            "purport": "Purport\nMaterial compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word \u201cMadhus\u016bdana\u201d is significant in this verse. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress \u2013 the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a \u015b\u016bdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This realization is possible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated in the fixed conception of the real self."

            "purport": "Purport\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is referred to as Bhagav\u0101n throughout the G\u012bt\u0101. Bhagav\u0101n is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (1.2.11) this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:\nvadanti tat tattva-vidastattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayambrahmeti param\u0101tmetibhagav\u0101n iti \u015babdyate\n\u201cThe Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d\nThese three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun\u2019s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun\u2019s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine \u2013 its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature \u2013 may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagav\u0101n feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.\nThe Sanskrit word bhagav\u0101n is explained by the great authority Par\u0101\u015bara Muni, the father of Vy\u0101sadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagav\u0101n. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahm\u0101, Lord \u015aiva or N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, can possess opulences as fully as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 by Lord Brahm\u0101 himself that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagav\u0101n, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes:\n\u012b\u015bvara\u1e25 parama\u1e25 k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25sac-cid-\u0101nanda-vigraha\u1e25an\u0101dir \u0101dir govinda\u1e25sarva-k\u0101ra\u1e47a-k\u0101ra\u1e47am\n\u201cThere are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav\u0101n, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.\u201d (Brahma-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 5.1)\nIn the Bh\u0101gavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:\nete c\u0101\u1e41\u015ba-kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayamindr\u0101ri-vy\u0101kula\u1e41 loka\u1e41m\u1e5b\u1e0dayanti yuge yuge\n\u201cAll the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\u201d (Bh\u0101g. 1.3.28)\nTherefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.\nIn the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna\u2019s lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a expressed His surprise with the word kuta\u1e25, \u201cwherefrom.\u201d Such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as \u0100ryans. The word \u0101ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, or Bhagav\u0101n, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-\u0100ryans. Although Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-\u0100ryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen."

            "purport": "Purport\nArjuna was addressed as the son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, who happened to be the sister of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If the son of a k\u1e63atriya declines to fight, he is a k\u1e63atriya in name only, and if the son of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a acts impiously, he is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a in name only. Such k\u1e63atriyas and br\u0101hma\u1e47as are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a k\u1e63atriya. Arjuna was the most intimate friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle he would be committing an infamous act. Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and his relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart. Such false magnanimity was not approved by any authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (his spiritual master), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships."

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.\nWho is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (3.8.10) the perplexed man is described as follows: yo v\u0101 etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgy aviditv\u0101sm\u0101\u1e3b lok\u0101t praiti sa k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a\u1e25. \u201cHe is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.\u201d This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgi viditv\u0101sm\u0101l lok\u0101t praiti sa br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u1e25.\nThe k\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of \u201cskin disease.\u201d The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the G\u012bt\u0101. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a person, but to \u201cthe unborn within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d There is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s within and without. And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101."

He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a spiritual master like K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life.

But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious.\u201d (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47a)\nThe problems of material existence \u2013 birth, old age, disease and death \u2013 cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development.

They are seeking peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam \u2013 which constitute the science of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 through the bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the man in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nIf economic development and material comforts could drive away one\u2019s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 confirms this: k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47e pu\u1e47ye martya-loka\u1e41 vi\u015banti. \u201cWhen the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.\u201d Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.\nTherefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul.

The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned and in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord\u2019s eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of m\u0101y\u0101, or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upani\u1e63ads, will continue eternally. This statement of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s is authoritative because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a would not have stressed it so much \u2013 even for the future. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b may argue that the individuality spoken of by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s individuality? K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The G\u012bt\u0101 is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. When one accepts K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as an ordinary man, the G\u012bt\u0101 loses all importance. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great \u0101c\u0101ryas like \u015ar\u012b R\u0101m\u0101nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G\u012bt\u0101 that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee\u2019s approach to the teachings of the G\u012bt\u0101 is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G\u012bt\u0101 be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b explanation of the G\u012bt\u0101 is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012bs and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the G\u012bt\u0101. If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned."

            "purport": "Purport\nSince every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth \u2013 either material or spiritual \u2013 there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bh\u012b\u1e63ma nor for Dro\u1e47a, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one\u2019s work in life. So Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.\nAny man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature \u2013 both material and spiritual \u2013 is called a dh\u012bra, or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul\u2019s being unchangeable. As confirmed in the G\u012bt\u0101, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (san\u0101tana) and are called k\u1e63ara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the same \u2013 fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Param\u0101tm\u0101. He is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (m\u0101y\u0101), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of m\u0101y\u0101, no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by m\u0101y\u0101."

Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the k\u1e63atriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty.

Lord Caitanya took sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them.

By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist. In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (2.12.38) it is stated that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence (jyot\u012b\u1e41\u1e63i vi\u1e63\u1e47ur bhuvan\u0101ni vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u1e25).

That is the version of all seers of truth.\nThis is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, as well as in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and the energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time."

Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one\u2019s own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul\u2019s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (5.9) confirms this:\nb\u0101l\u0101gra-\u015bata-bh\u0101gasya\u015batadh\u0101 kalpitasya cabh\u0101go j\u012bva\u1e25 sa vij\u00f1eya\u1e25sa c\u0101nanty\u0101ya kalpate\n\u201cWhen the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.\u201d Similarly the same version is stated:\nke\u015b\u0101gra-\u015bata-bh\u0101gasya\u015bat\u0101\u1e41\u015ba\u1e25 s\u0101d\u1e5b\u015b\u0101tmaka\u1e25j\u012bva\u1e25 s\u016bk\u1e63ma-svar\u016bpo \u2019ya\u1e41sa\u1e45khy\u0101t\u012bto hi cit-ka\u1e47a\u1e25\n\u201cThere are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.\u201d\nTherefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.1.9) the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:\ne\u1e63o \u2019\u1e47ur \u0101tm\u0101 cetas\u0101 veditavyoyasmin pr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e25 pa\u00f1cadh\u0101 sa\u1e41vive\u015bapr\u0101\u1e47ai\u015b citta\u1e41 sarvam ota\u1e41 praj\u0101n\u0101\u1e41yasmin vi\u015buddhe vibhavaty e\u1e63a \u0101tm\u0101\n\u201cThe soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air (pr\u0101\u1e47a, ap\u0101na, vy\u0101na, sam\u0101na and ud\u0101na), is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.\u201d\nThe ha\u1e6dha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures \u2013 not for any material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.\nSo the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading vi\u1e63\u1e47u-tattva.\nThe influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.\nSuch atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabh\u0101, or superior energy. So whether one follows Vedic knowledge or modern science, one cannot deny the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 by the Personality of Godhead Himself."

There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material, bodily considerations."

            "purport": "Purport\nQualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or k\u016b\u1e6da-stha. The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval \u2013 that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.\nIn the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.18) we also find a similar passage, which reads:\nna j\u0101yate mriyate v\u0101 vipa\u015bcinn\u0101ya\u1e41 kuta\u015bcin na babh\u016bva ka\u015bcitajo nitya\u1e25 \u015b\u0101\u015bvato \u2019ya\u1e41 pur\u0101\u1e47ona hanyate hanyam\u0101ne \u015bar\u012bre\nThe meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipa\u015bcit, which means learned or with knowledge.\nThe soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies \u2013 whether man or animal \u2013 we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge \u2013 past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. But K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not like the forgetful soul. If so, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 would be useless.\nThere are two kinds of souls \u2013 namely the minute particle soul (a\u1e47u-\u0101tm\u0101) and the Supersoul (vibhu-\u0101tm\u0101). This is also confirmed in the Ka\u1e6dha Upani\u1e63ad (1.2.20) in this way:\na\u1e47or a\u1e47\u012by\u0101n mahato mah\u012by\u0101n\u0101tm\u0101sya jantor nihito guh\u0101y\u0101mtam akratu\u1e25 pa\u015byati v\u012bta-\u015bokodh\u0101tu\u1e25 pras\u0101d\u0101n mahim\u0101nam \u0101tmana\u1e25\n\u201cBoth the Supersoul [Param\u0101tm\u0101] and the atomic soul [\u2009j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul.\u201d K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or by His bona fide representative (the spiritual master)."

In Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\u2019s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction."

Even the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a previous verse (2.13).\nTransference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad, as well as the \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds \u2013 although they are the same in quality \u2013 one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one\u2019s changing his position from one tree to another, or from one body to another. The j\u012bva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master \u2013 as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a for instruction \u2013 the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Mu\u1e47\u1e0daka Upani\u1e63ad (3.1.2) and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad (4.7) confirm this:\nsam\u0101ne v\u1e5bk\u1e63e puru\u1e63o nimagno\u2019n\u012b\u015bay\u0101 \u015bocati muhyam\u0101na\u1e25ju\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e41 yad\u0101 pa\u015byaty anyam \u012b\u015bamasya mahim\u0101nam iti v\u012bta-\u015boka\u1e25\n\u201cAlthough the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend the Lord and knows His glories \u2013 at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.\u201d Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and is understanding the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from Him. And thus, hearing from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.\nArjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna\u2019s lamentation."

Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements. Fire weapons were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons. Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.\nThe M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b cannot explain how the individual soul came into existence simply by ignorance and consequently became covered by the illusory energy. Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Supreme Soul; rather, the individual souls are eternally separated parts of the Supreme Soul. Because they are atomic individual souls eternally (san\u0101tana), they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 also.

They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire.

In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious \u2013 that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

When Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spoke the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lok\u0101yatikas and Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas. Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions \u2013 now becoming fashionable in America \u2013 are also adhering to this philosophy, as are the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.\nEven if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul \u2013 as in the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy \u2013 there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika philosophy, the so-called soul or \u0101tm\u0101 vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such incidents. If there were no rebirth for the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected by sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mah\u0101-b\u0101hu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a k\u1e63atriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles."

Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument\u2019s sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested \u2013 that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.\nAnd if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (antavanta ime deh\u0101\u1e25) but that the soul is eternal (nityasyokt\u0101\u1e25 \u015bar\u012bri\u1e47a\u1e25), then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body."

Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahm\u0101, the first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matters for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps they have no idea that one must think of the soul, and thus make a solution to the material miseries.\nSome people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions and relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one\u2019s life is successful.\nThe easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 spoken by the greatest authority, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way."

One who gives protection from harm is called k\u1e63atriya (tr\u0101yate \u2013 to give protection). The k\u1e63atriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A k\u1e63atriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system has been followed even up to the present day by the k\u1e63atriya kings of Jaipur state. The k\u1e63atriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, k\u1e63atriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle.

The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the k\u1e63atriyas killed on the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets, as do the br\u0101hma\u1e47as who attain them by offering sacrifice.\nThere are two kinds of sva-dharmas, specific duties.

When one is liberated, one\u2019s sva-dharma \u2013 specific duty \u2013 becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as and k\u1e63atriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. Sva-dharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane sva-dharma is called var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or man\u2019s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained.

In the Par\u0101\u015bara-sm\u1e5bti, or religious codes made by Par\u0101\u015bara, the great sage and father of Vy\u0101sadeva, it is stated:\nk\u1e63atriyo hi praj\u0101 rak\u1e63an\u015bastra-p\u0101\u1e47i\u1e25 prada\u1e47\u1e0dayannirjitya para-sainy\u0101dik\u1e63iti\u1e41 dharme\u1e47a p\u0101layet\n\u201cThe k\u1e63atriya\u2019s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world.\u201d\nConsidering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets, whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case."

In other words, he would go to hell not by fighting but by withdrawing from battle."

There is no consideration of happiness or distress, profit or loss, victory or defeat in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That everything should be performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities.

            "purport": "Purport\nAccording to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sa\u1e45khy\u0101 means that which describes things in detail, and s\u0101\u1e45khya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna\u2019s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as S\u0101\u1e45khya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This S\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya, the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy was expounded in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who explained it to His mother, Devah\u016bti. It is clearly explained by Him that the puru\u1e63a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prak\u1e5bti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the G\u012bt\u0101. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prak\u1e5bti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.\nArjuna has already accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: \u015bi\u1e63yas te \u2019ha\u1e41 \u015b\u0101dhi m\u0101\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 prapannam. Consequently, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Param\u0101tm\u0101 in everyone\u2019s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.\nThus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word S\u0101\u1e45khya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic S\u0101\u1e45khya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, but even that S\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, S\u0101\u1e45khya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya and Lord Kapila\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya, as described in the Bh\u0101gavatam, are one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga and bhakti-yoga (s\u0101\u1e45khya-yogau p\u1e5bthag b\u0101l\u0101\u1e25 pravadanti na pa\u1e47\u1e0dit\u0101\u1e25).\nOf course, atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic s\u0101\u1e45khya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nOne should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform."

Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit. Aj\u0101mila performed his duty in some percentage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord.

But work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness carries a person again to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured br\u0101hma\u1e47a or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

The Caitanya-carit\u0101m\u1e5bta (Madhya 22.62) states:\n\u2018\u015braddh\u0101\u2019-\u015babde \u2013 vi\u015bv\u0101sa kahe sud\u1e5b\u1e0dha ni\u015bcayak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47e bhakti kaile sarva-karma k\u1e5bta haya\nFaith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one\u2019s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThe resolute purpose of a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is based on knowledge. V\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25: a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that V\u0101sudeva, or K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone \u2013 namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is satisfied by one\u2019s actions, then everyone will be satisfied.\nService in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As such, to be well versed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one\u2019s mission in life. \u015ar\u012bla Vi\u015bvan\u0101tha Cakravart\u012b \u1e6ch\u0101kura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:\nyasya pras\u0101d\u0101d bhagavat-pras\u0101doyasy\u0101pras\u0101d\u0101n na gati\u1e25 kuto \u2019pidhy\u0101yan stuva\u1e41s tasya ya\u015bas tri-sandhya\u1e41vande guro\u1e25 \u015br\u012b-cara\u1e47\u0101ravindam\n\u201cBy satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.\u201d\nThe whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body \u2013 not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer a chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts."

They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the Jyoti\u1e63\u1e6doma sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, unenlightened men are similarly attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.\nIn the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da section of the Vedas it is said, ap\u0101ma somam am\u1e5bt\u0101 abh\u016bma and ak\u1e63ayya\u1e41 ha vai c\u0101turm\u0101sya-y\u0101jina\u1e25 suk\u1e5bta\u1e41 bhavati. In other words, those who perform the four-month penances become eligible to drink the soma-rasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have soma-rasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called Nandana-k\u0101nana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of soma-rasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to such material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world."

Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Ved\u0101nta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101, or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upani\u1e63ads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The Upani\u1e63ads mark the beginning of transcendental life.\nAs long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and one\u2019s eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7). The living entities are parts and parcels of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore, revival of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (3.33.7) as follows:\naho bata \u015bva-paco \u2019to gar\u012by\u0101nyaj-jihv\u0101gre vartate n\u0101ma tubhyamtepus tapas te juhuvu\u1e25 sasnur \u0101ry\u0101brahm\u0101n\u016bcur n\u0101ma g\u1e5b\u1e47anti ye te\n\u201cO my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a ca\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101la [dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the \u0100ryan family.\u201d\nSo one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of the Ved\u0101nta and the Upani\u1e63ads thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prak\u0101\u015b\u0101nanda Sarasvat\u012b, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved\u0101nta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Ved\u0101nta philosophy; the best purpose of Ved\u0101nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. Ved\u0101nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Ved\u0101nta philosophy is Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and the highest Ved\u0101ntist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism."

Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.\nAs far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work performed as an obligation in terms of the scriptural injunctions, without desire for results, is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.\nArjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful. Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna."

And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the fight.

Persons in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness transcend the limit of \u015babda-brahma, or the range of the Vedas and Upani\u1e63ads."

It is said that every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. N\u0101s\u0101v \u1e5b\u1e63ir yasya mata\u1e41 na bhinnam (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Vana-parva 313.117). But a sthita-dh\u012br muni, as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni. The sthita-dh\u012br muni is always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He is called pra\u015b\u0101nta-ni\u1e25\u015be\u1e63a-mano-rath\u0101ntara (Stotra-ratna 43), or one who has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or V\u0101sudeva, is everything (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25). He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\u2019s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one\u2019s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always steady in his determination."

Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer to the question as to how the yog\u012b is situated. The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The yog\u012b, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents \u2013 like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independently. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not\u2019s, and some of them are do\u2019s. Unless one is able to follow the do\u2019s and the do-not\u2019s, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up its senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being taught here to use his senses for the service of the Lord, instead of for his own satisfaction. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within."

Lord \u015aiva was deep in meditation, but when P\u0101rvat\u012b agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result K\u0101rtikeya was born. When Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of M\u0101y\u0101-dev\u012b, but Harid\u0101sa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires."

Those who are without knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. Their so-called renunciation is called phalgu, or less important. On the other hand, a person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called pras\u0101dam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized, and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes pras\u0101dam in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service."

Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification. That is the proof of a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious man \u2013 one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present. Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who want to fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yog\u012bs who are after mystic powers are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires. But the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace."

In other words, desire for becoming K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one\u2019s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he fought because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization \u2013 namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or greater than Him. This understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the basic principle of real peace."

It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Attainment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.\nBrahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti means \u201cnot on the platform of material activities.\u201d Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as the liberated stage (sa gu\u1e47\u0101n samat\u012btyait\u0101n brahma-bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate). Therefore, br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti is liberation from material bondage.\n\u015ar\u012bla Bhaktivinoda \u1e6ch\u0101kura has summarized this Second Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the subject matters are karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga. In the Second Chapter karma-yoga and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse of bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Second Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of its Contents."
