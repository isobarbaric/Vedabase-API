            "purport": "Purport\nActually the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is finished in seventeen chapters. The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yogin\u0101m api sarve\u1e63\u0101m\u00a0\u2026 \u201cOf all yog\u012bs or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.\u201d In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the words o\u1e41 tat sat, which indicate Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Person. The third part of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 has shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past \u0101c\u0101ryas and the Brahma-s\u016btra, the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra. Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, but actually the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101.\nAs in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, namely renunciation (ty\u0101ga) and the renounced order of life (sanny\u0101sa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.\nTwo words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord \u2013 H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba and Ke\u015bi-ni\u1e63\u016bdana \u2013 are significant. H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Ke\u015bi-ni\u1e63\u016bdana. Ke\u015b\u012b was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of doubt."

In the Vedic literature there are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose. There are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice for the purification of one\u2019s heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up."

For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain that animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself."

Should a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up. Viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind so that it may become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this viv\u0101ha-yaj\u00f1a should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life. Sanny\u0101s\u012bs should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual life."

Differences are perceived in terms of the body; because there are many forms of material existence in conditional life, the living force appears to be divided. Such impersonal knowledge is an aspect of self-realization."

Thus the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all living entities. This is confirmed in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra \u2013 janm\u0101dy asya yata\u1e25. The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And as stated in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.\n Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by H\u1e5b\u1e63\u012bke\u015ba, the master of the senses. And by the result of the work in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, should be worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (12.7), te\u1e63\u0101m aha\u1e41 samuddhart\u0101. The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord he will achieve the highest perfection."

            "purport": "Purport\nOne\u2019s occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, k\u1e63atriya, vai\u015bya and \u015b\u016bdra are prescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another\u2019s duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by \u015b\u016bdras should not artificially claim to be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although he may have been born into a br\u0101hma\u1e47a family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. For a k\u1e63atriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a k\u1e63atriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a k\u1e63atriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a k\u1e63atriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a.\nOne should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya. He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, \u201cOh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit,\u201d but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a. That is not recommended. Whether one is a k\u1e63atriya, a vai\u015bya, or a \u015b\u016bdra doesn\u2019t matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a k\u1e63atriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yaj\u00f1a, or for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord."

            "purport": "Purport\nIn conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a k\u1e63atriya, however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a \u015b\u016bdra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.\nA very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a k\u1e63atriya and take up the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, he is not assured that in the occupation of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization."

By such a mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation.

But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further, to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bh\u016bta, oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.\nIn the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has nothing for which to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God\u2019s service, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living entity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the brahma-bh\u016bta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one\u2019s individuality becomes hellish, the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like serpents whose poison teeth are broken. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age."

If anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. As already stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (7.25), n\u0101ha\u1e41 prak\u0101\u015ba\u1e25 sarvasya: He is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service can understand what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is. University degrees are not helpful.\nOne who is fully conversant with the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the word vi\u015bate, \u201centers into Me,\u201d supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No. Vi\u015bate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in one\u2019s individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.\nBecause of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.\nAfter attainment of the brahma-bh\u016bta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one\u2019s hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bh\u016bta stage develops, and material contamination \u2013 greediness and lust for sense enjoyment \u2013 disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam also. After liberation the process of bhakti, or transcendental service, continues. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (4.1.12) confirms this: \u0101-pr\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101t tatr\u0101pi hi d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dam. This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam, real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is a part-and-parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life."

Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master is unaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not present how should one act? If one acts according to the direction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word mat-para\u1e25 is very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness just to satisfy K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And while working in that way, one should think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a only: \u201cI have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something whimsically he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. One should act according to the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is a very important point. That order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master\u2019s order should be taken as the prime duty of life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then one\u2019s perfection of life in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is guaranteed."

No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master, who is the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 that will keep one safe under all circumstances."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a high-speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires. The living entity is not independent. One should not think himself independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under the Lord\u2019s control. Therefore one\u2019s duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse."

One should not even divert his attention to other forms of the Lord. The Lord has multiforms as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, R\u0101ma, Var\u0101ha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear friend of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s."

            "translation": "Translation\nAbandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.",
            "purport": "Purport\nThe Lord has described various kinds of knowledge and processes of religion \u2013 knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.\nIn the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.\nThe process of surrender to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is described in the Hari-bhakti-vil\u0101sa (11.676):\n\u0101nuk\u016blyasya sa\u1e45kalpa\u1e25pr\u0101tik\u016blyasya varjanamrak\u1e63i\u1e63yat\u012bti vi\u015bv\u0101sogopt\u1e5btve vara\u1e47a\u1e41 tath\u0101\u0101tma-nik\u1e63epa-k\u0101rpa\u1e47ye\u1e63a\u1e0d-vidh\u0101 \u015bara\u1e47\u0101gati\u1e25\nAccording to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reactions.\nOne should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. His name is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists \u2013 some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Karma-yog\u012bs, empiric philosophers, mystics and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here, m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25, \u201cDon\u2019t fear, don\u2019t hesitate, don\u2019t worry,\u201d are very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, but such worry is useless."

In other words, Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is for the devotees only. But it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class not all the students are expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that although not everyone is a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the Lord.\nGenerally those who are free from sinful reactions, those who are righteous, very easily take to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The word pu\u1e47ya-karma\u1e47\u0101m is very significant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifices, like the a\u015bvamedha-yaj\u00f1a, mentioned in the Vedic literature. Those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is presiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet, which is called the polestar."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-discipline. \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity\u2019s constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusory m\u0101y\u0101 or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101 to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.\nThe word moha is very important in this verse. Moha refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is acting according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s order. A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of m\u0101y\u0101. Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was not only his friend but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. So to study Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. When Arjuna understood that it was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s desire. He again took up his weapons \u2013 his arrows and bow \u2013 to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

This means that one has to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is still direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and yog\u012bs all over the world, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all yoga systems. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 \u2013 surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. One who does so is the topmost yog\u012b.

Therefore Vy\u0101sa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sa\u00f1jaya is the direct disciple of Vy\u0101sa. Therefore by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya\u2019s senses were purified, and he could see and hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. One who directly hears K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a can understand this confidential knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned.\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, all the yoga systems \u2013 karma-yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga \u2013 are explained. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly, so, by the grace of Vy\u0101sa, Sa\u00f1jaya was also able to hear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly. Actually there is no difference between hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and hearing directly from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a via a bona fide spiritual master like Vy\u0101sa. The spiritual master is the representative of Vy\u0101sadeva also. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master the disciples conduct the ceremony called Vy\u0101sa-p\u016bj\u0101."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 began with an inquiry of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra\u2019s. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Dro\u1e47a and Kar\u1e47a. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sa\u00f1jaya told the King, \u201cYou are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.\u201d He directly confirmed that Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was there. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also the master of renunciation.\nThe fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. Because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira\u2019s victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sa\u00f1jaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.\nThere are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: man-man\u0101 bhava mad-bhakta\u1e25. One must become a devotee of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (sarva-dharm\u0101n parityajya m\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja). The instructions of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the G\u012bt\u0101 is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.\nFrom Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in devotional service in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.\nAnother feature of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.\nIn Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth \u2013 impersonal Brahman, localized Param\u0101tm\u0101 and any other transcendental conception \u2013 exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya\u2019s philosophy is that of \u201cinconceivable oneness and difference.\u201d This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.\nThe living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of its Conclusion \u2013 the Perfection of Renunciation."
