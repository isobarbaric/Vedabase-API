            "purport": "Purport\nIn this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sanny\u0101sa, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether or work with full knowledge."

            "purport": "Purport\nFruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (5.5.4\u20136) confirms this as follows:\nn\u016bna\u1e41 pramatta\u1e25 kurute vikarmayad indriya-pr\u012btaya \u0101p\u1e5b\u1e47otina s\u0101dhu manye yata \u0101tmano \u2019yamasann api kle\u015ba-da \u0101sa deha\u1e25\npar\u0101bhavas t\u0101vad abodha-j\u0101toy\u0101van na jij\u00f1\u0101sata \u0101tma-tattvamy\u0101vat kriy\u0101s t\u0101vad ida\u1e41 mano vaikarm\u0101tmaka\u1e41 yena \u015bar\u012bra-bandha\u1e25\neva\u1e41 mana\u1e25 karma-va\u015ba\u1e41 prayu\u1e45kteavidyay\u0101tmany upadh\u012byam\u0101nepr\u012btir na y\u0101van mayi v\u0101sudevena mucyate deha-yogena t\u0101vat\n\u201cPeople are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\u2019s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real identity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for fruitive results for sense gratification, and as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to V\u0101sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence.\u201d\nTherefore, j\u00f1\u0101na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one\u2019s advancement in real knowledge. Without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by \u015ar\u012bla R\u016bpa Gosv\u0101m\u012b in his Bhakti-ras\u0101m\u1e5bta-sindhu (1.2.258):\npr\u0101pa\u00f1cikatay\u0101 buddhy\u0101hari-sambandhi-vastuna\u1e25mumuk\u1e63ubhi\u1e25 parity\u0101govair\u0101gya\u1e41 phalgu kathyate\n\u201cWhen persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their renunciation is called incomplete.\u201d Renunciation is complete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, everything should be employed in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This perfect form of action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sanny\u0101s\u012b of the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b school."

The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy, whereas the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs are engaged in the study of Bh\u0101gavatam philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs also study the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras, but use their own commentary, called \u015a\u0101r\u012braka-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, written by \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya. The students of the Bh\u0101gavata school are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, according to p\u0101\u00f1car\u0101trik\u012b regulations, and therefore the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs, engaged in the studies of S\u0101\u1e45khya and Ved\u0101nta and speculation, cannot relish the transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bh\u0101gavatam without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs. The Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava sanny\u0101s\u012bs, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The M\u0101y\u0101v\u0101d\u012b sanny\u0101s\u012bs sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious activities are better situated than the sanny\u0101s\u012bs engaged in simple speculation about what is Brahman and what is not Brahman, although they too come to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, after many births."

This is due to his K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body. Because one who works in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, there is no chance of his being deviated from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; and he does not wish to go anywhere if K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, \u201cWhy then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn\u2019t he in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness?\u201d Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk\u1e63etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe Sanskrit word vibhu means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is a\u1e47u, or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Param\u0101tm\u0101, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities. However, when one desires K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare, e\u1e63a u hy eva s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati ta\u1e41 yam ebhyo lokebhya unnin\u012b\u1e63ate. e\u1e63a u ev\u0101s\u0101dhu karma k\u0101rayati yam adho nin\u012b\u1e63ate: \u201cThe Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so that he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so that he may go to hell.\u201d (Kau\u1e63\u012btak\u012b Upani\u1e63ad 3.8)\naj\u00f1o jantur an\u012b\u015bo \u2019yam\u0101tmana\u1e25 sukha-du\u1e25khayo\u1e25\u012b\u015bvara-prerito gacchetsvarga\u1e41 v\u0101\u015bv abhram eva ca\n\u201cThe living entity is completely dependent in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.\u201d\nTherefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras (2.1.34) also confirm this.

It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, sarva\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101na-plavena, j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101gni\u1e25 sarva-karm\u0101\u1e47i and na hi j\u00f1\u0101nena sad\u1e5b\u015bam. Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, nineteenth verse: bah\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 janman\u0101m ante j\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or when one attains K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is, for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\u2019s relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge."

The whole Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 centers around the declaration that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. Para-tattva means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101 and Bhagav\u0101n. Bhagav\u0101n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than that. The Lord says, matta\u1e25 paratara\u1e41 n\u0101nyat ki\u00f1cid asti dhana\u00f1-jaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a: brahma\u1e47o hi prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101ham. Therefore in all ways K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the Supreme Reality.

A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation."

This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Param\u0101tm\u0101, is present in everyone\u2019s heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Param\u0101tm\u0101 regardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present both in the outcaste and in the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, although the body of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and that of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body whereas the Param\u0101tm\u0101 is present in each and every body. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful.

A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analogous example of this:\ndar\u015bana-dhy\u0101na-sa\u1e41spar\u015bairmatsya-k\u016brma-viha\u1e45gam\u0101\u1e25sv\u0101ny apaty\u0101ni pu\u1e63\u1e47antitath\u0101ham api padma-ja\n\u201cBy vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!\u201d\nThe fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, the devotee in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, although far away from the Lord\u2019s abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly \u2013 by engagement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a, or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme."

            "purport": "Purport\nBeing engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can immediately understand one\u2019s spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of devotional service. When one is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the sphere of one\u2019s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme.\nAfter explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of the mysticism or yoga known as a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the praty\u0101h\u0101ra process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half-closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up-moving and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.\nThis yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In other words, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of controlling the senses than by a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe conditioned souls within the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101. In the Vedas (\u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upani\u1e63ad 6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as tam \u012b\u015bvar\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 parama\u1e41 mahe\u015bvara\u1e41. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness: Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThis Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one\u2019s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\u0101y\u0101, and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\u2019s practical performance of duties in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, \u0101sana, pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101ma, praty\u0101h\u0101ra, dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101, dhy\u0101na and sam\u0101dhi. But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Consciousness."
