            "purport": "Purport\nIn the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as daiv\u012b prak\u1e5bti, transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities and the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.\nThe word abhij\u0101tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-sa\u1e41sk\u0101ra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles recommended for the social life of the human being. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Himself. Sex life is not condemned, provided the process is used in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Those who are in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so that they may become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father and mother absorbed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.\nThe social institution known as var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma \u2013 the institution dividing society into four divisions of social life and four occupational divisions or castes \u2013 is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so that he can get liberated from the material world.\nIn the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama institution the sanny\u0101s\u012b, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. A br\u0101hma\u1e47a is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k\u1e63atriyas, the vai\u015byas and the \u015b\u016bdras, but a sanny\u0101s\u012b, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as also. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sanny\u0101s\u012b has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one thinks, \u201cAfter I leave my connections, who will protect me?\u201d he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is always within, that He is seeing everything, and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as Param\u0101tm\u0101 will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. \u201cI shall never be alone,\u201d one should think. \u201cEven if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and He will give me all protection.\u201d That conviction is called abhayam, fearlessness. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.\nThen he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny\u0101s\u012b is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b, and when He was at Pur\u012b His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sanny\u0101s\u012b not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sanny\u0101s\u012b, intimate relations with women and possession of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny\u0101s\u012b was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sanny\u0101sa order of life in connection with association with women. One of His personal associates, namely Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa, was associated with Lord Caitanya along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho\u1e6da Harid\u0101sa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, \u201cFor a sanny\u0101s\u012b or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification \u2013 not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity \u2013 is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.\u201d So these are the processes for purification.\n The next item is j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga-vyavasthiti: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sanny\u0101s\u012b life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sanny\u0101s\u012b is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sanny\u0101s\u012b goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. This is the duty of a sanny\u0101s\u012b. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness with logic and understanding, and if one is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if one has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sanny\u0101s\u012b, or one in the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa\u1e41\u015buddhi (purity) and j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga (knowledge).\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charity, as will be explained later on \u2013 charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.\nThen as far as dama (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality, but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If he is able to beget children who will be in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.\nSacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Those in other orders of life, namely brahmacarya, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householders. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a. This sa\u1e45k\u012brtana-yaj\u00f1a, the chanting of Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare, is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\nThen sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya, Vedic study, is meant for brahmacarya, or student life. Brahmac\u0101r\u012bs should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya.\nTapas, or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life \u2013 brahmacarya, g\u1e5bhastha, v\u0101naprastha and sanny\u0101sa. So after g\u1e5bhastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasya. The entire var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma society is meant for tapasya. Without tapasya, or austerity, no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is recommended neither in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. Such theories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don\u2019t restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\nAs far as the brahminical quality of simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmac\u0101r\u012b \u0101\u015brama, g\u1e5bhastha \u0101\u015brama, v\u0101naprastha \u0101\u015brama or sanny\u0101sa \u0101\u015brama. One should be very simple and straightforward.\nAhi\u1e41s\u0101 means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi\u1e41s\u0101 means not checking anyone\u2019s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one\u2019s palate. This is called ahi\u1e41s\u0101.\nSatyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding the Vedas. \u015aruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.\nAkrodha means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is a product of the mode of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai\u015bunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr\u012b means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. Ac\u0101palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination.\nThe word tejas used here is meant for the k\u1e63atriyas. The k\u1e63atriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it. But a person who is able to curb down his enemy may under certain conditions show forgiveness. He may excuse minor offenses.\n\u015aaucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one\u2019s dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. N\u0101ti-m\u0101nit\u0101, not expecting honor, applies to the \u015b\u016bdras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the \u015b\u016bdras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\nAll these twenty-six qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of social and occupational order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization."

            "purport": "Purport\nIn every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which is followed from the beginning. Especially among the \u0100ryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples, those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.\n As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101 it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101. But modern education has artificially devised a puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. The social condition of women is thus not very good now, although those who are married are in a better condition than those who are proclaiming their so-called freedom. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable."

They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance, just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence. Then when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation.

We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man\u2019s desire. The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.\nThe demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Upani\u1e63ads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is unlimited. He thinks only of how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth further and further. For that reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification. He is enamored by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of one\u2019s personal ability. They do not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep \u2013 between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.\nEach demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: \u201cWhy are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don\u2019t believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.\u201d These are the demoniac\u2019s preachings.\nAlthough the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more influential than he. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\u00f1as, or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaj\u00f1a and prepare some machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was R\u0101va\u1e47a. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangements. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word moha-j\u0101la is very significant. J\u0101la means \u201cnet\u201d; like fish caught in a net, they have no way to come out."

Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one\u2019s own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow.

It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras \u2013 R\u0101va\u1e47a, Ka\u1e41sa, Hira\u1e47yaka\u015bipu \u2013 to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill them.

Everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled. And even if he accepts the existence of God, if he does not engage himself in the service of the Lord his attempts are spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.\nThe word k\u0101ma-k\u0101rata\u1e25 is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, but still he acts. This is called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one\u2019s existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness."

            "purport": "Purport\nAs stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas are meant for knowing K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. If one understands K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a from the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and becomes situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of \u015b\u0101stra, or scripture. \u015a\u0101stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the \u015b\u0101stra \u2013 being above these defects \u2013 are accepted without alteration by all great saints, \u0101c\u0101ryas and great souls.\nIn India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the \u015b\u0101stras is considered fortunate.\nIn human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, m\u0101y\u0101, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one\u2019s life becomes successful.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures."
