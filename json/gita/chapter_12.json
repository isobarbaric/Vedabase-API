            "purport": "Purport\nK\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yog\u012bs. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist also engages himself, not directly in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.\nWe find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.\nThose who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.\nIn the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, the Supreme Lord explained that a living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the Absolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. Then again in the Eighth Chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all yog\u012bs, one who always thinks of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a within himself is considered the most perfect. So in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, for that is the highest spiritual realization.\nNevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. They are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries to Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 they want to distract other people from K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and transfer all devotion to the impersonal brahma-jyotir. They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest.\nAnd so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, \u201cWhat is the use of such a waste of time?\u201d Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This important question asked of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth."

            "purport": "Purport\nThe group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called j\u00f1\u0101na-yog\u012bs, and persons who are in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yog\u012bs. Now, here the difference between j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yog\u012b accepts the Deity of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be sagu\u1e47a or nirgu\u1e47a \u2013 of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is sagu\u1e47a worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.\n A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation which we may find somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arc\u0101-vigraha. This arc\u0101-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arc\u0101-vigraha He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.\n So for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani\u1e63ads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam. It is stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called bhakti), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.\n A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual, blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus the process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "purport": "Purport\nIt is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord \u2013 and if he does not, then he will render service to m\u0101y\u0101.\nAs stated before, the Supreme Lord can be appreciated only by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life\u2019s mission is to please K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and he can sacrifice everything for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk\u1e63etra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.\nThe Supreme Lord herein promises that without delay He will deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him. The devotee does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.\nIn the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a this verse appears:\nnay\u0101mi parama\u1e41 sth\u0101namarcir-\u0101di-gati\u1e41 vin\u0101garu\u1e0da-skandham \u0101ropyayatheccham aniv\u0101rita\u1e25\nThe purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice a\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garu\u1e0da, and at once delivers the devotee from material existence. Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u012bya this is confirmed as follows:\ny\u0101 vai s\u0101dhana-sampatti\u1e25puru\u1e63\u0101rtha-catu\u1e63\u1e6dayetay\u0101 vin\u0101 tad \u0101pnotinaro n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47\u0101\u015braya\u1e25\nThe purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.\nSimply by chanting the holy name of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a \u2013 Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, Hare Hare/ Hare R\u0101ma, Hare R\u0101ma, R\u0101ma R\u0101ma, Hare Hare \u2013 a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.\nThe conclusion of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:\nsarva-dharm\u0101n parityajyam\u0101m eka\u1e41 \u015bara\u1e47a\u1e41 vrajaaha\u1e41 tv\u0101\u1e41 sarva-p\u0101pebhyomok\u1e63ayi\u1e63y\u0101mi m\u0101 \u015buca\u1e25\nOne should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life, because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. That is the highest perfection of life."

When he offers K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a food, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and in other Vedic literatures."

The first applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\nBhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification. But by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don\u2019t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.\nThis love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone\u2019s heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material association. Now the heart has to be purified of the material association, and that dormant, natural love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a has to be revived. That is the whole process.\nTo practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take pras\u0101dam, and so on. There are various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 and \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God."

So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities.

If one attaches himself directly to the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions for the full-moon day, and there is special work in which the result of one\u2019s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one\u2019s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Of course, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is not dependent on any other experience, because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness itself can purify one\u2019s mind, but if there are impediments to accepting K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, one may try to give up the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one\u2019s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (18.46) we find it is stated, yata\u1e25 prav\u1e5bttir bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m: if one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, he will come gradually to understand that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method."

            "purport": "Purport\nAs mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulative principles and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge, because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. In the cultivation of knowledge there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras, which we shall find in the last chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause.\nIn summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one\u2019s activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take either the step-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

            "purport": "Purport\nComing again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy\u2019s enemy; he thinks, \u201cThis person is acting as my enemy due to my own past misdeeds. So it is better to suffer than to protest.\u201d In the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam (10.14.8) it is stated: tat te \u2019nukamp\u0101\u1e41 su-sam\u012bk\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47o bhu\u00f1j\u0101na ev\u0101tma-k\u1e5bta\u1e41 vip\u0101kam. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord\u2019s mercy upon him. He thinks, \u201cThanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the pains and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equipoised in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled he is determined. He is not swayed by false arguments, because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All these qualifications enable him to fix his mind and intelligence entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtedly very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness."

It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is always engrossed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and engaged in devotional service, such material circumstances cannot move him. Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn\u2019t, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected. A devotee who is always transcendental to all these disturbances is very dear to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

He is never pained, because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of devotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations."

But a devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak; silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak for the sake of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this is just to emphasize the fact that a devotee must acquire all these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee. Har\u0101v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\u1e47\u0101\u1e25: one who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop them."

Such processes are very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question of who is better \u2013 one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \u2013 was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.\nThus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the \u015ar\u012bmad Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 in the matter of Devotional Service."
